["The Wide, Wide World", "The Wide, Wide World is an 1850 novel by Susan Warner, published under the pseudonym Elizabeth Wetherell. It is often acclaimed as America's first bestseller. \n \n ==Plot== \n The Wide, Wide World is a work of sentimentalism about the life of young Ellen Montgomery. The story begins with Ellen's happy life being disrupted by the fact that her mother is very ill and her father must take her to Europe, requiring Ellen to leave home to live with an almost-unknown aunt. Though Ellen tries to act strong for her mother's sake, she is devastated and can find solace in nothing. \n \n Eventually the day comes when Ellen must say goodbye to her mother and travel in the company of strangers to her aunt's home. Unfortunately these strangers are unkind to Ellen and she tries to leave the boat on which they are traveling. An old man sees Ellen crying and tells her to trust in God. He teaches her about being a Christian, as her mother had done, and asks her if she is ready to give her heart to Jesus. After talking with the man, Ellen becomes determined to become a true Christian, which gives her strength for the rest of the journey to her aunt's place in Thirwall. \n \n On Ellen's first night in Thirwall, she learns that her father forgot to inform her aunt that she was coming, so a  \" Mr. Van Brunt \"  escorts her to her aunt's home. This aunt, Fortune Emerson, proves to be quite different from Ellen's loving mother: she treats Ellen unkindly and refuses to let her attend school. Ellen hates living with Fortune and comes to find comfort in the society of Mr. Van Brunt and other neighbors as she becomes more familiar with her new surroundings. \n \n One day, discovering that her aunt withheld a letter from Mrs. Montgomery, Ellen runs crying into the woods. There she meets Alice Humphreys, the daughter of a local minister. Alice is kind to Ellen and invites her to tea the next day, to give Ellen a chance to tell her troubles; maybe Alice would be able to help. The girls become fast friends and Alice adopts Ellen as a sister, offering to educate her and guide her spiritually, teaching her to forgive others and trust in the Lord. \n \n Alice and her brother John, who is away at school much of the time, treat Ellen like family, even inviting her to spend Christmas in the nearby town of Ventnor with them and their friends, the Marshmans. While there, Ellen meets another Ellen, Ellen Chauncey. She also gets better acquainted with John Humphreys, who comforts her many times after the other children tease her. Ellen comes to realize that if she hadn't needed to be separated from her mother, she might never have met Alice and John. \n \n About a year later, one day when Ellen visits town, she overhears from some ladies' conversation that her mother has died. Devastated, she turns to Alice and her Bible for comfort. She stays with Alice and John until Aunt Fortune becomes ill and Ellen must look after her. Eventually Aunt Fortune recovers and Ellen returns to Alice and her other friends. \n \n After Mr. Van Brunt's mother dies, he decides to marry Aunt Fortune; soon after, Alice tells Ellen that she is very ill and will soon be  \" going home \"  to Heaven; Ellen is not to grieve for her but to trust in God. She also invites Ellen to take her place in the Humphreys household. Ellen immediately moves in and begins by nursing Alice through her final weeks. After Alice dies, Ellen turns to John for guidance. He takes over as her tutor, spiritual advisor, and guiding light. By the time a Humphreys relative dies in England and John must travel overseas to handle the family's business, Ellen (though sad to see him go) is a stronger person. \n \n One day Nancy visits Ellen, bringing letters she has found while cleaning Fortune's house. They are for Ellen from her mother and express the wish that Ellen go live with relatives in Scotland; after sharing the letters with Mr. Humphreys,  Ellen decides she must honor her parents' wishes so the Humphreys send her to Scotland to live with the Lindsays: her grandmother and uncle Lindsay and Lady Keith. They welcome her into their home and find her delightful, but they become very possessive of her and force her to denounce her identity as an American and as a Montgomery. Mr. Lindsay even makes Ellen call him \u201cfather\u201d and refers to her as his \u201cown little daughter.\u201d The Lindsays also discourage Ellen's faith, as they don't see religion as being important to someone Ellen's age. Ellen finds it hard to live without her daily hours set aside for studying religion, but still tries hard to live by her faith and everything that John and Alice taught her. \n \n Ellen misses John more than anything, and during a New Year's Eve party at the Lindsays', he shows up asking for her. The Lindsays try to keep them apart, but they are unsuccessful. During their emotional reunion John reminds Ellen to keep her faith; in a few years, when she will be able to choose where she lives, she can return to America and live with him. When Ellen introduces John to the Lindsays, they actually become fond of him. John must soon return to America, but not without promising Ellen that they will be together forever soon. In an unpublished chapter at the end of the book, Ellen returns to America as Mrs. John Humphreys. \n \n ==Characters== \n Primary Characters: \n * Ellen Montgomery: The story's protagonist. Young and na\u00efve at the story's beginning, Ellen lives happily with her mother as her sole companion and teacher. After being torn away from her mother, Ellen struggles to learn to love God and live a Christian life in the face of adversity. \n * Mrs. Montgomery: Ellen's mother. Plagued with health problems, Mrs. Montgomery finds comfort only in Ellen and God. Although unable to perform many of the duties of a mother and wife, she does her best to teach Ellen about God and how to be a lady. \n * Fortune Emerson: Captain Montgomery's half-sister is stern and unfeeling towards Ellen from the beginning. She refuses to let Ellen attend school and even withholds her mother's letter from Ellen. \n * Alice Humphreys: Daughter of a minister. Kind and gentle, she becomes Ellen's companion and spiritual counselor and helps Ellen find solace in the Lord while living with Aunt Fortune. Eventually Alice becomes sick and dies, but not before teaching Ellen to learn to trust in God. \n * John Humphreys: Alice's beloved brother.  A handsome and charming young man, he becomes as close as a brother to Ellen (as Alice becomes as close as a sister). After Alice's death, John becomes Ellen's guide through the world, teaching her how to be a good Christian and a good person. \n * The Lindsays: Ellen's family on her mother's side. Grandmother Lindsay; and Mr. Lindsay and Lady Keith, Ellen's uncle and aunt; adopt her readily into their family but become extremely possessive of her and make her denounce her identity as an American and a Montgomery. They also discourage Ellen's devotion to her faith. \n \n Secondary Characters \n \n * Captain Montgomery: Ellen's negligent father was often away from home and felt little sympathy for wife or daughter during their forced separation. \n * Mr. Van Brunt:  Fortune's farmhand. He is intimidating at first, though Ellen learns to love him. He feels kindly towards Ellen, often defending her when her aunt mistreats her. \n * Nancy Vawse: A girl who lives nearby with her grandmother, she is thought by most to be  \" a bad sort \" ; though Ellen doesn't like her at first, she proves later to be a better person. \n * Mrs. Vawse: Nancy's grandmother, a kindly old lady who lives on a mountain. She teaches French to Ellen and Alice and later cares for Ellen after Alice dies and John returns to school. \n * Mr. Humphreys: Alice and John's father, a local minister. He is a quiet man who keeps to himself, though Ellen becomes like a daughter to him and comforts him after Alice dies. \n * The Marshmans: Humphreys-family friends who live in a nearby town. They are kind to Ellen and treat her well when she is with them. \n * Ellen Chauncey: A young girl Ellen meets while staying with the Marshmans. \n * Margery: Alice's loyal servant who came from England with the Humphreys. She helps Ellen learn to take Alice's place in the household. \n \n ==Themes== \n This book was originally written with the goal of teaching people a Christian lesson, so many of the themes are Christian in nature and aim to show people how a true Christian ought to live his or her life. \n \n * One of themes present in The Wide, Wide World is that everything in life, even the bad things, is caused by God and leads to something good, especially in the spiritual sense. Ellen is very sad when she learns that her mother must leave, but reminds herself that the trip will make her mother healthy again. When she goes to the store to try and buy some merino cloth, she meets a salesman who treats her very badly and makes her cry, but as a result she gets to know a generous old gentleman who provides her with certain things for her trip that she might not have gotten otherwise. On the steamboat, the other girls make fun of Ellen and send her crying off to another part of the boat, but through this she met a man who teaches her many things about Christianity. When at the Marshmans\u2019 house, she meets children who give her a hard time with her faith, but her friend Alice and Ellen Chauncey are there for her and comfort her. Through this theme, Susan Warner wanted people to see that God did not send misery upon his children for no reason, but used suffering as a means to bring them closer to Him. Ellen learns this and is better able to cope with problems in her life. \n * Another theme present in the novel is that there are always good people present among the bad folks. Mr. Saunders, a cold-hearted clerk, is contrasted with an old gentleman who is very kind to Ellen. Captain Montgomery, a man who doesn't seem to care much for his daughter or her mother, is married to Mrs. Montgomery, a kind woman who loves Ellen with all of her heart. Ellen is forced to travel with Mrs. Dunscombe and her daughters, who find pleasure in mocking Ellen and her less-than-ideal clothes. After leaving them, Ellen meets a young man who spends much time with Ellen, teaching her about becoming a Christian and sincerely caring for the little girl. Aunt Fortune, who makes it obvious that Ellen is unwanted at her house, lives close to Mrs. Van Brunt, an older woman who cares for Ellen and acts kindly to her. Ellen meets people at the Marshmans\u2019 Christmas party who give her a hard time on purpose, but she has many friends there as well. This seems to be saying that even though a person might be surrounded with bad people who make everyone around them suffer, there are still many kind people in this world that will offer their help when the time comes. Ellen meets many different kinds of people throughout the story, some of which are annoying and taunt her faith in God, but some who become real friends and shape Ellen's personality. \n * A third theme that is present in this book is that those who desire to grow spiritually will receive the help of God if they honestly have that desire. When talking to her mother before the parting, Ellen is determined to live a perfect, Christian life and be an example for everyone around her. However, as soon as she gets on the boat, she discovers that her heart holds negative feelings towards the people around her. After meeting the Christian man on the boat, she realizes how hard her heart is, and her desire to live a good life is rekindled. She fails at this again, however, when she gets to Aunt Fortune's house, where she directly disobeys her aunt and throws fits when things aren't done to her liking. But she realizes her mistakes and wants to be good, and God sends her a young woman who acts as a spiritual guide for the girl. Through this, Warner was telling people not to give up when they made mistakes, and showing how God comes to those who seek him. Since The Wide, Wide World is a Christian book, it aimed to teach readers how seek God and encourage those who didn't exactly know how to go about doing that, but had a true desire to be closer to Him. \n * Another theme seen in the story is that God has an unlimited supply of strength, and is willing to give it to anyone who desires it. Poor Ellen went through just about everything in her life. By the age of 10, she was separated from her mother forever, mistreated at the hands of others, mocked for her faith in God, and forced to move from her homeland. However, instead of whining and complaining she asks God to help her, and she is not left alone in this world. Warner knew that times weren't easy for everyone, just like today, and wanted people to know that there was an everlasting source of encouragement available at any time of day, anywhere in the world. She uses Ellen as an example, who doesn't despair but, with God's help, lives happily after she marries John. \n \n ==Conflicts== \n The driving conflict of this story is the separation of Ellen from her mother and the effects of this separation on Ellen, including how she misses the mother who had meant everything to her, how she struggles with being a good Christian, and how she deals with people who don't care about her. \n \n * Woman vs. Self \n As a work of sentimentalist literature, the conflict created by the story is dealt with almost entirely through the emotional response that Ellen has to the conditions in which she is put in the novel. In this, the main conflicts that Ellen encounters deals with how she can internally deal with each of the emotional problems she is met with in a way that is characteristic of strength and perseverance. \n \n * Woman vs. Nature \n Ellen's mother leaving for France due to her sickness is the conflict which sets the entire narrative in motion, which occurs at the very start of the story. The first few chapters deal with how Ellen prepares to cope with the separation while simultaneously ensuring that, on the advice of the doctor, she refrains from causing any extra stress or fatigue on her mother. After her departure, Ellen must come to terms with being able to survive without the one person who truly cared for her. \n \n * Woman vs. God \n With her mother's departure, Ellen finds herself doubting God's intentions, and struggles with the idea that she must love God despite the hardships he has given her, chiefly being separated from her mother, and attempt to come to terms with the idea that God has separated Ellen from her mother and sent her to her aunt in order to be taught that strong faith in God is the most important aspect in her life, over and above her love for her mother. \n \n * Woman vs. Society \n Most of the personal conflicts with other characters are also dealt with in the internal manner, chiefly the struggles Ellen has in dealing with her callous and uncaring Aunt Fortune, who shows no sympathy for Ellen's sadness in being detached from her mother immediately upon meeting. Aunt Fortune's disregard for the feelings of Ellen leads to most of the external turmoil Ellen faces in the first half of the book, including her indifference to allow Ellen to go to school. \n \n ==Literary Style== \n \n There are three main aspects which created Warner's particular writing style in The Wide, Wide World. The first aspect is the time in which the book was written. With Webster having furthered the development of the American dialect with his 1828 publication of the first American dictionary, America was still gaining its own literary voice in 1850 when The Wide, Wide World was published. \n \n It is readily apparent from the first page that this novel's style is archaic with lines such as  \" Driven thus to her own resources, Ellen betook herself to the window and sought amusement there. \" < ref name= \" Baym \" > Baym, Nina. Woman's Fiction: A Guide to Novels by and about Women in America, 1820-1870. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1978. < /ref > \n \n The next aspect of Warner's style is that The Wide, Wide World is also a didactic piece. Warner's style was aimed at giving an accurate portrayal of the social limitations imposed upon nineteenth-century women, and aimed at promoting the benefits of Christian morality. The Wide, Wide World was republished in 1987 by the Feminist Press, showing the claims it holds to furthering gender equality. And one can see that Warner's style was aimed at promoting Christian morals because one of the main themes of this novel is about finding strength in religious devotion. \n \n The Wide, Wide World is a paradigm of sentimentalist literature. The conflict and action of this story are largely introverted within the protagonist Ellen. The lines \u201cDressing was sad work to Ellen today; it went on very heavily. Tears dropped into the water as she stooped her head to the basin,\u201d  < ref name= \" Baym \"  / >  are found in a four-page stretch within which Ellen cries on five separate occasions, displaying how sentimental Warner's style was. \n \n Along with being a piece of sentimentalist literature, the work is considered an example of the domestic novel. The Wide, Wide World adheres to the basic plot of most women's fiction novels of the time, which, as Nina Baym describes the genre in Woman's Fiction, involves  \" the story of a young girl who is deprived of the supports she had rightly or wrongly depended on to sustain her throughout life and is faced with the necessity of winning her own way in the world.\u201d  < ref name= \" Baym \"  / > \n \n ==History== \n \" Published at the end of 1850, The Wide, Wide World by Susan Warner went through fourteen editions in two years, and may ultimately have been as popular as Uncle Tom's Cabin with 19th-century American readers \" . < ref name= \" Sentimental \" >  < /ref > \n \n Although it was first rejected by many publishers, Warner's first novel became an instant sensation among its readers. The novel paints an excellent picture of the Victorian era of the United States, and so the readers of the time appreciated its relevancy to their own lives. (Jo March reads the book in Little Women.) \n \n Pushing Christian values and themes, The Wide, Wide World was a guide to young ladies of the time who were encouraged to have submissive and humble attitudes towards their elders, especially men. The novel also portrayed a part of the author's own life: While Ellen's mother died when Ellen was young, Warner's mother had died when Warner was nine years old. Warner then went to live with her aunt, who was much kinder than Ellen's Aunt Fortune. < ref name= \" eNotes \" > \" The Wide, Wide World, Susan Warner: INTRODUCTION. \"  Nineteenth-Century Literary Criticism.

["The Werewolf of Ponkert", "The Werewolf of Ponkert is a collection of two horror short stories by H. Warner Munn.

["Boyracers", "Boyracers is the debut novel of Scottish writer Alan Bissett. It was first published in 2001 by Edinburgh-based Polygon Books. The plot concerns four male teenagers growing up in the town of Falkirk, exploring the influences of popular culture, global capitalism and social class on the lives of young people in contemporary Scotland. \n \n A tenth anniversary edition was produced in 2011. The same year, Bissett announced that he had finished work on a sequel entitled The Pack Men. < ref name=review/ > < ref >  < /ref > \n \n ==Summary== \n \n The narrative centres on 16-year-old Falkirk resident Alvin and his adventures with three slightly older friends. Alvin\u2019s formative development is tracked in the context of the group\u2019s activities, including boy-racing around the town in a car called Belinda and engaging in debates about film and music. He spends much of his time at school attempting to gain the attention of Tyra, his love interest, but is constantly hindered by Connor Livingston, an upper-middle class prefect who mocks Alvin and sneers at his social class, whilst also being interested in Tyra himself. As the most intellectually gifted of the group, Alvin struggles with the dilemma of choosing to continue his generally enjoyable local life or to leave his friends and the town behind and attend University. \n \n ==Critical reception== \n \n The book received a positive reception from critics in Scotland.

["Oracle Night", "Oracle Night is a 2003 novel by American author Paul Auster. \n \n The novel is about a writer named Sidney Orr (a short, Americanized version of the Polish surname Orlovsky), who, after making a miraculous recovery from near fatal illness, buys a new notebook and starts writing a story about a man who completely changed his life when he realised how much his existence was ruled by randomness. \n \n The base premises for the book is this, Sidney Orr trying to come back to his life and begin writing again, but a lot of things happen in his life at the same time, and the reader gets introduced not only to Sidney's work and personal life, but also in some extent to the life of the person in his work-in-progress novel. Before the end of this period in Sidney's life, events will take place that are truly life-altering, and Sidney will, much like the fictional character he writes of, have to deal with issues and questions he has previously (perhaps unconsciously) been avoiding for several years. \n \n ==Biographical== \n The main character, Sidney Orr, is in many ways quite similar to Paul Auster. They are both residents of Brooklyn, \n middle-aged, married, and, of course, writers. Some similarities between Auster and a supporting character \n in Oracle Night\u2014John Trause\u2014are also apparent. Trause, an anagram of Auster, also lived in Paris for a period of his life. \n \n ==External links== \n *  \n * http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/generalfiction/story/0,6000,1142856,00.html \n * http://living.scotsman.com/books.cfm?id=57412004 \n * http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/review/3451735.stm \n * http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/generalfiction/0,6121,1142671,00.html \n \n  \n \n Category:2004 American novels \n Category:Novels by Paul Auster \n Category:Henry Holt and Company books \n Category:Novels about writers \n Category:Novels set in Brooklyn", ["Paul Auster", "Henry Holt and Company", "Faber  &  Faber", "novel", "Paul Auster", "Category:2004 American novels", "Category:Novels by Paul Auster", "Category:Henry Holt and Company books", "Category:Novels about writers", "Category:Novels set in Brooklyn"]]

It was the first sequel to his 1924 novel Beau Geste and was turned into a film in 1928. \n \n ==Plot== \n It focuses on the adventures of Major Henri de Beaujolais from adolescence to maturity as a well-connected cavalry officer in the French Army: he's an Old Etonian; his mother a Devonshire Cary; his deceased father a Frenchman; his paternal uncle the youngest General in the French Army and married to the sister of the French Minister of State for War. Starting as a one-year volunteer trooper in a hussar regiment, De Beaujolais graduates from the Cavalry School of Saumur to become an officer of Spahis and a member of the French Secret Service.

["Book of Artifacts", "The Book of Artifacts (abbreviated as BoA < ref name= \" D & Dfaq \" >  < /ref > ) is a supplemental sourcebook to the core rules of the second edition of the Advanced Dungeons  &  Dragons fantasy role-playing game.  This book, published by TSR, Inc. in 1993, details 50 different artifacts, special magic items found within the game at the Dungeon Master's option. The book was designed primarily by David  \" Zeb \"  Cook, with some additional design by Rich Baker, Wolfgang Baur, Steve and Glenda Burns, Bill Connors, Dale  \" Slade \"  Henson, Colin McComb, Thomas M. Reid, and David Wise. Cover art is by Fred Fields and interior art and icons were designed by Daniel Frazier. \n \n ==Introduction== \n The book's 8-page introduction on pages 3\u201310 provides an overview of the contents and the significance of artifacts within the game. One page is spent in an attempt to clear up some misconceptions regarding artifacts, including  \" Artifacts are too powerful for a campaign, \"   \" All artifacts have horrible curses that keep them from being useful, \"   \" Artifacts are just collections of random powers, \"   \" Artifacts are all created by gods that shouldn't be involved in the campaign, \"   \" Artifacts are found only in the Greyhawk campaign, \"   \" If the characters stumble across an artifact, it could ruin the campaign, \"   \" A character with an artifact will ruin the adventure, \"  and  \" Artifacts are nothing but a headache. \"  The next four pages of the introduction provide an explanation of the book's contents by chapter, defines what makes an artifact different from other magic items (an artifact is unique, has a special history, and provides an impetus for a story to be centered on it) and includes a set of guidelines on how a Dungeon Master can create a new artifact for the campaign. \n \n The remaining three pages of the introduction serve to explain how the specific artifacts described within the book operate. It explains the common elements of how all artifacts function within a game, and details two common types of special curses an artifact might cause: artifact possession, where an artifact's will can possess a character using the item, and artifact transformation, where the artifact literally transforms a character physically and mentally over time into something else entirely. The format for the artifact descriptions found in the next section is also explained. Each artifact is given a detailed in-game history consisting of one or more paragraphs, and each one provides a section of advice on how the Dungeon Master may use the item within a campaign. Each artifact has its most significant powers detailed, each of which falls into one of five categories: constant (always in effect), invoked (activated intentionally by the character), random (determined by the Dungeon Master or by random roll), resonating (only functioning when two or more pieces of a matched set are joined), and curse (such as artifact possession, artifact transformation, or something else). Lastly, the introduction describes how each artifact has a suggested means of destruction, none of which should be easy for a character to accomplish. \n \n ==Artifacts== \n Fifty individual artifacts are described on pages 11\u2013106. Most descriptions take up one full page, but a few require more than one page, and all are illustrated. Many of these artifacts have existed since the game's early days, and were originally found in the 1976 supplement Eldritch Wizardry: Axe of the Dwarvish Lords, Baba Yaga's Hut, Codex of the Infinite Planes, Crystal of the Ebon Flame, Hand and Eye of Vecna, Heward's Mystical Organ, Horn of Change, Invulnerable Coat of Arnd, Iron Flask of Tuerny the Merciless, Jacinth of Inestimable Beauty, Mace of Cuthbert, Machine of Lum the Mad, Mighty Servant of Leuk-o, Orbs of Dragonkind, Queen Ehlissa's Marvelous Nightingale, Regalia of Might (Regalia of Good, Regalia of Neutrality, Regalia of Evil), Ring of Gaxx, Rod of Seven Parts, Sword of Kas, and Throne of the Gods. < ref > Gygax, Gary, and Brian Blume. Eldritch Wizardry (TSR, 1976) < /ref >  Some of the artifacts in the Book of Artifacts originally appeared in the first edition Dungeon Master's Guide (along with the ones first found in Eldritch Wizardry) in 1979, including: Cup and Talisman of Al'Akbar, Johydee's Mask, Kuroth's Quill, Recorder of Ye'Cind, and Teeth of Dahlvar-Nar. < ref > Gygax, Gary. Dungeon Master's Guide (TSR, 1979) < /ref > \n \n Many of the artifacts in this book originated within other products and magazine articles, mostly for specific campaign settings, including: Acorn of Wo-Mai (The Horde: Barbarian Campaign Setting), Apparatus (Ravenloft II: House on Gryphon Hill), Artifurnace (Spelljammer campaign set), Axe of the Emperors (Dragonlance: DLR2 Taladas - The Minotaurs), Blackjammer's Cutlass (Spelljammer: Dragon #159), Book with No End (Dungeon #3), Death Rock (Kara-Tur), Hammer of Gesen (The Horde: Barbarian Campaign Setting), Iron Bow of Gesen (The Horde: Barbarian Campaign Setting), and Triad of Betrayal (Dragonlance: Tales of the Lance). Some of the remaining artifacts made their first appearance in the Book of Artifacts, including: All-Knowing Eye of Yasmin Sira (Al-Qadim), Coin of Jisan the Bountiful (Al-Qadim), Herald of Mei Lung, Ivory Chain of Pao, Monacle of Bagthalos (Forgotten Realms), Obsidian Man of Urik (Dark Sun), Psychometron of Nerad (Dark Sun), Rod of Teeth (Dark Sun), Scepter of the Sorcerer-Kings (Forgotten Realms), Seal of Jafar al-Samal (Al-Qadim), and Silencer of Bodach (Dark Sun). \n \n ==Creating Magical Items== \n This section, from pages 107-129, describes the methods that a character uses to create ordinary magic items (not artifacts) as described in the second edition Dungeon Master's Guide and Tome of Magic. This section details how high in level a character must be to create a particular item, describes the requirements of the work area a character must have to create an item (a wizard's laboratory or a priest's altar, as the case may be), the difficulty of making a particular item, and what sort of magical materials may be needed. It also describes that in order to create an intelligent magic item, the spellcaster's life-force is transferred into the item, leaving the caster's body a lifeless husk. \n \n ==Recharging Magical Items== \n This section, from pages 130-136, describes how a spellcaster character can recharge an item which uses charges, such as wands, rods, staves, and some rings. It describes how this process is completed and what is required, both for wizard items and priest items. \n \n ==Appendices== \n The book ends with a set of three appendices. Appendix A, on page 137 is a list of common rechargeable magical items, referring to the book's previous section. Appendix B, on pages 138-158, is a set of random power tables that some artifacts may possess. Appendix C, on page 159, is simply a blank chart for the Dungeon Master to fill out to assign a list of songs, and their effects, for the Heward's Mystical Organ artifact. \n \n ==Reviews== \n Review: White Wolf #41 (1994) \n *Backstab #15 < ref >  < /ref > \n \n ==References== \n  \n \n  \n \n Category:1993 books \n Category:Dungeons  &  Dragons sourcebooks", ["David Cook (game designer)", "Role-playing game", "TSR, Inc.", "Hardback", "Wizards of the Coast", "Dungeons  &  Dragons", "fantasy", "role-playing game", "TSR, Inc.", "Magic item (Dungeons  &  Dragons)", "Dungeon Master", "David Cook (game designer)", "Richard Baker (game designer)", "Wolfgang Baur", "Steve Burns (game designer)", "Glenda Burns", "William W.

["100 Great Welsh Women", "100 Great Welsh Women is a collection of short biographies of prominent women from Wales, or of Welsh origin, published in 2001 by Terry Breverton. \n It covers women from all walks of life, including athletes, actresses, saints, singers and queens. \n \n ==Background== \n \n 100 Great Welsh Women was written by Terry Breverton and published in 2001. \n Breverton is a historian who has written more than 20 books. \n The books are typically on subjects related to Wales and include 100 Great Welshmen, An A-Z of Wales and the Welsh, The Secret Vale of Glamorgan and The Book of Welsh Saints. \n \n ==Content and style== \n \n The book opens with a biography of the 5th\u20136th century Saint Almedha and ends with the 19th century Jane Williams. \n The book includes biographies of Tracy Edwards, yachtswoman, who in 1997 traveled  in four days across the Atlantic with a 10-woman crew; Petula Clark, the popular singer; Megan Lloyd George, the politician and feminist; Queen Elizabeth I of England; Bette Davis, the film star; Saint Claudia; Saint Darerca and the famous Queen Boudica, who led British resistance against the Romans. \n Other biographies include the singers Charlotte Church and Shirley Bassey; the athlete Tanni Grey-Thompson; Nell Gwyn, the mistress of Charles II; Saint Helena, mother of Constantine the Great; and the actress Catherine Zeta-Jones. \n Also covered are Kylie Minogue, Nest ferch Rhys, George Eliot, Sarah Siddons, Si\u00e2n Phillips, Laura Ashley, Mary Quant, Myrna Loy and Esther Williams. \n \n The book is carefully researched and well written. \n The selection of subjects is somewhat idiosyncratic, and readers may disagree with the author's choice. For example, Breverton states that he chose to exclude Margaret Roberts, better known as Margaret Thatcher, due to his dislike of that famous Prime Minister's policies. \n \n ==Publication== \n \n 100 Great Welsh Women was published as a paperback by Glyndwr Publishing, St. Athan, in November 2001. \n It has 304 pages, and includes 72 black-and-white photographs. \n As of 2016 it was out of print. \n \n ==Reception== \n \n The book gained attention in the media mainly because it included the Australian pop star Kylie Minogue. \n Meic Stephens wrote of 100 Great Welshmen and 100 Great Welsh Women in the Western Mail Magazine on 16 March 2002,  \" These are not necessarily books that you want to read from cover to cover, but to browse in ... Both are really extraordinary achievements by a single author whose industry and enterprise seem to show no bounds. \"  \n Norma Penfold of the Welsh Books Council wrote,  \" All in all, 100 Great Welsh Women is an informative reference book as well as a fascinating read. \"  \n Jonathan Hourigan wrote in the Sunday Express,  \" Breverton's breadth, generosity and sheer enthusiasm about Wales are compelling. \"  \n According to Dr Peter N. Williams,  \" The book is an absolute must for all those who value their Welsh heritage, and for all those who wish to see Welsh women accorded their rightful place in history. \"  \n \n ==Notes== \n  \n \n ==Sources== \n  \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n Category:2001 books \n Category:Welsh books \n Category:Biographies (books) \n Category:Women in Wales", ["Biography", "Wales", "Terry Breverton", "Saint Almedha", "Jane Williams", "Tracy Edwards", "Petula Clark", "Megan Lloyd George", "Elizabeth I of England", "Bette Davis", "Saint Claudia", "Darerca of Ireland", "Boudica", "Charlotte Church", "Shirley Bassey", "Tanni Grey-Thompson", "Nell Gwyn", "Helena (empress)", "Constantine the Great", "Catherine Zeta-Jones", "Kylie Minogue", "Nest ferch Rhys", "George Eliot", "Sarah Siddons", "Si\u00e2n Phillips", "Laura Ashley", "Mary Quant", "Myrna Loy", "Esther Williams", "Margaret Thatcher", "Kylie Minogue", "Meic Stephens", "BBC", "Daily Mirror", "Sunday Express", "Category:2001 books", "Category:Welsh books", "Category:Biographies (books)", "Category:Women in Wales"]]

["The Tiger Who Came to Tea", "The Tiger Who Came to Tea is a short children's story, first published by William Collins, Sons in 1968, written and illustrated by Judith Kerr. < ref >  < /ref >  The book concerns a girl called Sophie, her mother, and an anthropomorphised tiger who invites himself to their afternoon tea and consumes all the food and drink they have. The book remains extremely popular < ref name= \" grannies \" >  < /ref >  more than 50 years after it was first published, and a theatrical adaptation of the story has been produced. A television adaptation of the book aired on UK's Channel 4 on Christmas Eve 2019 at 7:30pm GMT. \n \n The original artwork for the book is held by Seven Stories, a children's literature centre in the UK. \n \n ==Plot== \n \n A little girl named Sophie is having tea with her mother in their kitchen, when she hears the doorbell ring. Soon, Sophie and her mother are joined for tea by a kind tiger who drinks all the tea before eating all the food in the house and then drinking everything, even draining all the water from the taps. After the tiger leaves, Sophie's father comes home from work and suggests that they all go out and have a lovely meal in a cafe. The following day, Sophie and her mother go out to buy some more food, including a big tin of tiger food. Despite the tin of tiger food being requested by Sophie, the tiger never returns (hence the tiger plays a trumpet with the word  \" Goodbye \"  coming out of the end of it). \n \n ==Inspiration== \n Kerr spent her early years in Berlin just before the start of the Third Reich and her father was on a death list because of his opposition to the Nazis. Her family fled Germany and most of their property was seized in 1933 when she was nine years old. Michael Rosen, also a children's author, claims the tiger could be based on her memory of the past threat: something that could have disrupted her life as a young child and taken everything the family owned. \n < blockquote > Judith knows about dangerous people who come to your house and take people away. She was told as a young child that her father could be grabbed at any moment by either the Gestapo or the SS - he was in great danger.

["The Life of Sir William Petty, 1623\u20131687", "The Life of Sir William Petty 1623-1687 is a book, written by Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice, and published in 1895.  It is a biography of Sir William Petty, the 17th-century scientist, known for his inventions, his charting of large parts of Ireland, in the Down Survey, and his publications on many different topics, like  \" political arithmetic \"  and political economy. \n \n == Bibliographical information == \n   \n 335 p. < ref name=online > Also available online: \n * via OPACplus (),  \n * via UMDL Texts (),  \n * on Internet Archive; two scanned versions: version 1 and version 2, \n * and finally three scanned versions in HathiTrust Digital Library. < /ref > \n \n Fitzmaurice founded his biography of Sir William Petty largely on the manuscripts in the so-called 'Bowood' papers. The papers originally belonging to Sir William Petty passed to his grandson, John Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne (1706-1761), who bought Bowood House in Wiltshire, England in 1754. < ref name=bowood > History of Bowood House (accessed 2017-10-06). < /ref > \n \n The letters written by Sir William Petty to Sir Robert Southwell (1635-1702) were later added to the Bowood papers by the 3rd Marquis of Lansdowne. \n \n Apart from the Bowood papers, Fitzmaurice also studied manuscripts in the British Museum, in the Bodleian Library and in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin. \n \n thumb|right|260px|Sir William Petty \n thumb|right|260px|Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice \n \n == The biographer: Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice == \n Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice (1846-1935), also named Edmond George Petty-Fitzmaurice, was a descendant of William Petty and a liberal politician. He also published a biography of his great-grandfather, William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne in 1912, biographies of Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville (in 1905) and of Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel (in 1901), and some theatre plays. \n \n == The biography == \n The biography is chronological. In the first chapter the life of Petty up to 1652 is summarized. It ends with his application as surgery-general in Cromwell's Irish army. \n \n In the second and third chapter, which cover a total of 80 pages, an extensive description is given of the Down Survey, the cadastral survey carried out by Petty in 1655 and 1656, and especially on the long aftermath of that survey. After the survey Petty was accused of fraud and bribery, and it took him years to clear his name. \n \n The next chapters cover the period from 1660 to 1678, in which Petty published much of the works that, centuries later, brought him fame among economists and statisticians. A separate, central chapter (Chapter 7) is devoted to his  \" Political Arithmetic \"  (and his opinions concerning political economy). \n \n The last three chapters give an overview of the period from 1678 until Petty's death in 1687. \n \n == Critical reception == \n The Life of Petty was reviewed in different journals. \n \n  wrote a review in Die Neue Zeit, 1896. \n He was happy to see that a biography on William Petty had appeared: 'Finally, more than two hundred years after his death, the most genial of the English political economists  of the seventeenth century has found his biographer', writes Cunow in his review in Die Neue Zeit in 1896. But, does he write subsequently, the (large amount of) work that is done by Fitzmaurice, does not provide a satisfactory result and does not offer a clear image of the character (of Petty). Questions like 'what where the influences that worked on Petty's intellectual development?' are not answered and only on very few places insight is given into the depth of Petty's ideas ('Ideenwelt'). Neither gives Fitzmaurice an account of the less attractive sides of Petty's character, like his ruthless addiction to profitmaking. \n \n Cunow also makes some remarks concerning Bevan's Sir William Petty: A Study in English Economic Literature (1894). \n \n  wrote a review in The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science of 1896, together with a review of . \n Hull finds a sharp distinction between the first six chapters (1623-1678) and the last chapters. In the first chapters Fitzmaurice  \" writes chiefly from sources already well known (\u2026).. Relatively little that is new appears. \"  Whereas the latter part of the book is largely based on (until then less known) Petty's correspondence with Sir Robert Southwell (1635-1702) and on several unprinted letters to Lady Petty. \n \n  wrote a review in The American Historical Review, 1895. He thought that a reader will profit of this book, full of information, and giving abundant means of arriving at a fair estimate of Petty's character,  \" only in proportion to what he already knows of the period; and even those who have some tolerable acquaintance with the time will find themselves at a loss to explain many of the allusions with which Petty's papers are bestrewn. The note on pages 296, 301,\u2013 \" the allusion is not clear, \" \u2013might stand with equal propriety at the foot of many other pages. \" \n \n == References == \n  \n \n ==  Bibliography == \n *  (see also: this page (visited 2018-08-27).) \n \n *  \n *  \n *  (also includes a review of ) \n \n  \n Category:1895 non-fiction books \n Category:Books about William Petty", ["Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice", "William Petty", "John Murray (publishing house)", "biography", "Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice", "Sir William Petty", "Down Survey", "political arithmetic", "political economy", "John Murray (publishing house)", "Internet Archive", "HathiTrust", "John Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne", "Bowood House", "Wiltshire", "Sir Robert Southwell (diplomat)", "Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne", "British Museum", "Bodleian Library", "Library of Trinity College, Dublin", "File:Sir William Petty.

He is sent by Emperor Gregor to the planet Kibou-daini ( \" New & nbsp;Hope \" ) to investigate White Chrysanthemum Cryonics Corporation. WhiteChrys, a major  \" cryocorp \" , to which sick or dying people go to be frozen in hopes of one day being revived and cured, is opening a subsidiary on Komarr, arousing suspicions. The narrative follows three points of view: those of Miles, his Armsman Roic, and Jin Sato, a local Kibou-daini boy. \n \n At a conference, an attempt is made to kidnap Miles and the other attendees. Miles avoids capture because an allergic reaction to the drug used on him makes him extremely hyperactive, and escapes into the below-ground Cryocombs, where the frozen are stored. Roic is caught along with Raven, a cryo-revival specialist from the Durona Group who assisted in reviving Miles after his death on Jackson's Whole (detailed in Mirror Dance). \n \n When Miles finds his way back to the surface, he encounters Jin, an eleven-year-old boy living with his chickens and other pets in a disused building.

["Chainfire", "Chainfire is the ninth book in Terry Goodkind's epic fantasy series The Sword of Truth, and the first in a trilogy. It was nominated for the Prometheus Award. \n \n ==Plot introduction== \n During a raid on his camp, Richard is seriously wounded and now Nicci must use Subtractive Magic in order to save him. Richard awakens to find his wife Kahlan missing and discovers that he is the only person alive who remembers her. As he begins to search for her, he learns that he is also hunted by a beast created by Jagang's Sisters of the Dark. \n \n ==Plot summary== \n Richard Rahl is the ruler of the D'Haran Empire, a collection of nations previously made up of D'Hara and the Midlands. Richard Rahl and the D'Haran Empire are currently locked in an epic struggle with the Imperial Order, an Empire from the Old World, led by Emperor Jagang. \n \n Chainfire continues the story of Richard in his attempt to teach the people that their lives are theirs alone, and that they can be free of the Imperial Order. Richard is gravely injured from an enemy's arrow. He is brought to Nicci, a sorceress and former Sister of the Dark, who heals him using Subtractive Magic; this causes unforeseen events to spiral out of control. When Richard awakens, he discovers that his wife, Kahlan Amnell, the Mother Confessor, is missing. Furthermore, no one around him seems to remember her. Nicci and Cara both attribute Richard's memory of Kahlan to dreams and delusions brought on by his injury and possibly an unintended effect of the Subtractive Magic used in healing Richard. Despite Richard's attempts to explain the events of the last several years could not have happened without Kahlan, the paradoxes are explained away as Richard remembering things inaccurately. \n \n Fearing for Kahlan's life, Richard desperately tries to find some trace of her and at the same time convince the others that she exists. His search leads him to the witch woman, Shota, who reveals  \" that which you seek is long buried with the bones \" . In return for more information, Shota demands the Sword of Truth, which Richard relinquishes to her pet, Samuel, the previous bearer of the sword. Shota then utters the words  \" Chainfire \"  and  \" The Deep Nothing \"  and tells Richard to  \" beware the four-headed viper \" . She also warns Richard of a  \" blood beast \"  conjured by several wizards and Sisters of the Dark, under the orders of Jagang. The beast is meant to kill Richard and is as unstoppable as it is unpredictable. Further, the beast is able to track Richard when he uses his gift because of the way Nicci healed his arrow wound. \n \n In the meantime, Ann and Nathan together have discovered many blank pages in books of ancient prophecy. They seem to remember that the pages should not be blank but cannot remember what was originally written there. Zedd makes the same discovery independently. \n \n Leaving Agaden Reach, Richard makes his way to the Wizard's Keep to find Zedd, but he also has no memory of Kahlan. Nicci arrives simultaneously. To prove Kahlan's existence, Richard exhumes her grave and is shocked to find a corpse in the buried casket with a nametag attached to her dress. He is devastated and falls into a deep depression. Meanwhile, Ann, Nathan, and Frederich also arrive at the Keep. Desperate to get their  \" Richard \"  back so that he will  \" fulfill prophecy \"  and lead the D'Haran army against the forces of Emperor Jagang. Zedd, Nathan, and Ann attempt to coerce Nicci into secretly using Subtractive Magic to delete Richard's  \" delusions \" ; Nicci instead begs Richard to persevere in his beliefs. Together with Cara, they head to the Sliph to travel to the People's Palace. \n \n Richard learns that the Sliph knows of a place called the Deep Nothing. The Sliph takes them to some ruins called  \" Caska \"  in the Deep Nothing. Upon arriving, they find themselves in the midst of a group of Imperial Order advanced scouts who have captured a girl named Jillian, part of a people called the  \" Dream Casters \" . While Nicci eliminates the rest of the Imperial Troops scouts, Richard and Jillian look for answers in the catacombs. Together, they find a hidden passage that leads to a protected library. In the library, Jillian discovers a book titled Chainfire. \n \n At the same time, the reader learns that Kahlan indeed exists, and has been kidnapped by the four remaining Sisters of the Dark who escaped the Dream Walker in Blood of the Fold. The Sisters have cast a spell called Chainfire, using Subtractive Magic to erase people's memories of Kahlan and Kahlan's memories of herself. The Sisters then use Kahlan to steal the boxes of Orden from the Garden of Life in the People's Palace. Kahlan leaves Spirit behind, the statue Richard carved for her. \n \n Richard, Nicci, and Cara then travel to the People's Palace and learn that the boxes are missing and that they have been put into play. Richard finds the statue Kahlan left and figures out that the Sisters have stolen his wife and the boxes. With the proof in the Garden of Life, Nicci and Cara finally believe in the existence of Kahlan, despite not remembering her. While there, they learn that an older woman has been found fatally stabbed near the D'haran army; Nicci and Richard determine that it is Sister Tovi. Nicci uses deception to interrogate Tovi, discovering that it was Samuel who stabbed Tovi and took the Box of Orden she was carrying. She also learns about the Chainfire spell, about how it was used to obliterate everyone's memory about Kahlan, and that the Boxes of Orden were created in opposition to it. Later, Richard realizes that the Sword of Truth protected him from the Chainfire spell, which is why he was still able to remember Kahlan. \n \n Richard, Nicci and Cara return to the Wizard's Keep and, with the information gathered from Tovi and the book  \" Chainfire \" , they finally manage to convince Zedd, Nathan, and Ann of the truth. While no one but Richard remembers Kahlan, they now believe that she exists. \n \n ==Characters== \n  \n \n ==Chainfire magic== \n \n The spell is explained as a complicated memory-altering magic. But it is not as simple as erasing the memory of everyone directly, as this is merely Subtractive Magic. Also, simply attempting to erase the memory because it uses Subtractive Magic, has a strong probability of destroying portions of the mind, thus killing the subject. A death spell, can for instance, make it seem like a person is dead, but everyone still remembers the person existed.  Also, if you tried to erase the knowledge of even a simple person like a woodcutter, the nature of reality would be such that all too obvious gaps in memory would be noticed, such as how the woodcutter's wife got her food and wood if she were crippled. For this reason, some wizards came up with a workaround, using some energy to warp reality itself or at least human perception of it.  False memories are automatically created to fill the gaps in reality, almost as if someone went back in time and changed them. \n \n ==Wizard's Ninth Rule== \n The Wizard's Ninth Rule, revealed in Chainfire, is: \n \n  \n \n It is explained in the novel as follows:  \" To believe in a contradiction is to abdicate your belief in the existence of the world around you and the nature of the things in it, to instead embrace any random impulse that strikes your fancy \u2013 to imagine something is real simply because you wish it were. A thing is what it is, it is itself. There can be no contradictions. In reality, contradictions cannot exist. To believe in them you must abandon the most important thing you possess: your rational mind. The wager for such a bargain is your life. In such an exchange, you always lose what you have at stake. \" \n \n ==References== \n  \n  \n \n ==External links== \n *Official Terry Goodkind website \n *'Chainfire' book review, November 9, 2006 \n \n  \n \n Category:The Sword of Truth books \n Category:2005 American novels \n Category:2005 fantasy novels \n Category:American fantasy novels \n Category:Tor Books books", ["Terry Goodkind", "Keith Parkinson", "The Sword of Truth", "Epic fantasy", "Tor Books", "Hardback", "Naked Empire", "Phantom (Sword of Truth)", "Terry Goodkind", "epic fantasy", "The Sword of Truth", "trilogy", "Prometheus Award", "Richard Rahl", "Kahlan Amnell", "List of The Sword of Truth characters#Cara", "List of The Sword of Truth characters#Samuel", "Prelate Annalina", "Nathan Rahl", "Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander", "Blood of the Fold", "Category:The Sword of Truth books", "Category:2005 American novels", "Category:2005 fantasy novels", "Category:American fantasy novels", "Category:Tor Books books"]]

["Trent's Last Case", "Trent's Last Case is a detective novel written by E. C. Bentley and first published in 1913. Its central character, the artist and amateur detective Philip Trent, reappeared subsequently in the novel Trent's Own Case (1936), and the short-story collection Trent Intervenes (1938). < ref >  < /ref > \n \n Trent's Last Case is actually the first novel Philip Trent appears in, and is a whodunit with a place in detective fiction history because it is the first major send-up of that genre. Not only does Trent fall in love with one of the primary suspects \u2013 usually considered off-limits \u2013 he also, after painstakingly collecting all the evidence, draws all the wrong conclusions. \n \n The novel was published as The Woman in Black in the United States, later in 1913. \n \n ==Plot summary== \n Sigsbee Manderson, a wealthy American plutocrat, is found shot dead in the grounds of his English country house. Philip Trent, an artist, freelance journalist, and amateur detective, is commissioned by Sir James Molloy, a Fleet Street press magnate, to investigate and report on the case. Trent receives the co-operation of the police \u2013 the investigating officer, Inspector Murch of Scotland Yard is an old acquaintance \u2013 and is able to view the body, examine the house and grounds, and interview those involved. Other members of the household include Manderson's wife, Mabel; his two secretaries, Calvin Bunner, an American, and John Marlowe, an Englishman; Martin, a manservant; and C\u00e9lestine, a lady's maid. Nathaniel Cupples, Mabel's uncle-by-marriage and another old friend of Trent, is staying at a hotel in the village. \n \n Trent pursues his enquiries, and learns that the Mandersons' marriage was in difficulties and that the couple had grown distant from each other. In the course of his investigation, he falls in love with Mabel Manderson. The coroner's inquest finds that Manderson was killed by a person or persons unknown: the suggestion is that he was the victim of a business vendetta. Trent, however, concludes that Manderson was shot by Marlowe, who then returned to the house wearing some of Manderson's outer clothing in order to give the impression that Manderson was at that point still alive, before driving to Southampton to provide himself with an alibi. Trent believes that Marlowe's motive was his own love for Mabel, but is unclear as to how far she may have reciprocated in these feelings. He writes down his ideas in the form of a dispatch for Molloy, but before sending it presents it to Mabel and asks whether there had been anything between her and Marlowe. Her reaction persuades him that there had been, and he leaves the dispatch unsent. \n \n Six months later Trent re-establishes contact with Mabel in London and finally extracts her version of events. She tells him that there had never been any sort of intimacy between her and Marlowe, but that her husband's suspicions had been the cause of their marital rift, and that in his jealousy he may have plotted an act of revenge. Trent sends Marlowe his original dispatch and arranges a meeting at which Cupples is also present. At the meeting, Marlowe explains that Manderson fabricated a web of incriminating evidence to implicate Marlowe in his apparent  \" murder \"  and then shot himself. Having realised what was happening, and having discovered Manderson's body, Marlowe had attempted to cover his tracks and give himself an alibi \u2013 this much of Trent's analysis had been correct. \n \n Following this meeting, Trent and Cupples have dinner together, and Cupples reveals that while the majority of Marlowe's story had been accurate, it was in fact he who had fired the fatal shot. He had chanced upon Manderson pointing a pistol at himself, probably meaning only to cause a self-inflicted wound. Suspecting a suicide attempt, Cupples had intervened, and in the ensuing struggle had shot Manderson in the face. \n \n The book ends with Trent vowing that he will never again attempt to dabble in crime detection. \n \n ==Reception== \n  \n G. K. Chesterton, author of the Father Brown mysteries, felt that this novel was  \" The finest detective story of modern times \" .  (Bentley and Chesterton were close personal friends, and Bentley dedicated the book to Chesterton.)  Agatha Christie called Trent's Last Case  \" One of the three best detective stories ever written \" .  Dorothy Sayers wrote that  \" It is the one detective story of the present century which I am certain will go down to posterity as a classic. It is a masterpiece. \"  Literary critic Jacques Barzun included it in his top ten mystery novels. \n \n In his critique of the mystery genre, The Simple Art of Murder, Raymond Chandler ridiculed some plot points that he considered preposterous:  \" I have known relatively few international financiers, but I rather think the author of this novel has (if possible) known fewer. \" \n \n According to Aaron Marc Stein in his introduction to the 1977 edition, published by University Extension of UCSD:  \" At the risk of bringing down on his memory the wrath of the Baker Street Irregulars it must be recorded that Bentley had reservations about even the Conan Doyle originals. He deplored the great detective's lack of humor and he was irritated by the Sherlockian eccentricities.... Bentley had the idea of doing a detective who would be a human being and who would know how to laugh. \" \n \n ==Adaptations== \n ===Film=== \n The novel was adapted into a silent film directed by Richard Garrick in 1920. < ref >  < /ref >  A second adaptation (released in both a silent version and a sound version) was made by Howard Hawks in 1929. < ref >  < /ref > \n \n A third film adaptation was directed by Herbert Wilcox in 1952.

["Herbs and Apples", "Herbs and Apples is a 1925 novel by Helen Hooven Santmyer.  Her first novel, it was largely autobiographical.  Set in the fictional town of Tecumseh, Ohio, an unnamed Boston-area women's college, and Manhattan, it tells the story of Derrick Thornton, an aspiring female writer and poet, who ends up preferring the  \" herbs and apples \"  of Tecumseh to any sort of literary life. \n \n The novel received a minor reception at the time, but otherwise made no impact.  It was rediscovered when Santmyer became a literary sensation in 1984, and reissued in hardcover (Harper  &  Row, 1985) and paperback (St. Martin's Press, 1987), with an introduction and three poems by Santmyer. \n \n ==Plot== \n The story is told in the first person by Sue, who had met the young Derrick once, and then meets her a second time on the train taking them to the same college. At college, the two girls form a clique dedicated to literature and philosophy with four other freshmen, Alice, Edith, Madeleine, and Frances.  Derrick is easily the most ambitious and talented of them, writing poetry. She argues forcefully that marriage is an abdication of artistic talent, and vows never to get married. \n \n During the summer between their freshman and sophomore years, World War I breaks out, and the United States enters the war a few months before they graduate.  Derrick, Sue, and Alice move to Manhattan, where Derrick finds a secretarial job working for a literary magazine. She continues to write poetry, and most of one play. On home visits, she argues with her childhood friend, Jack Devlin, whose support of pacifism angers her.  To her shock and fear, he enlists, and she agrees to consider marriage on his return. Jack is killed in action, and Derrick takes it very hard. \n \n Shortly afterwards, Derrick's mother becomes deathly ill, and Derrick moves back to Tecumseh, destroying her drafts. As the oldest child of six, she finds herself replacing her mother in her siblings' lives. She accepts a teaching job at an elementary school. Sue later visits, and barely recognizes Derrick, who is serene and happy with her lot. \n \n == Reception == \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n ==Notes== \n  \n \n ==Bibliography== \n \n ===Early book reviews=== \n *  \n *  \n *  \n \n ===Later book reviews=== \n *  \n *  \n \n  \n \n  \n Category:1925 American novels \n Category:Novels by Helen Hooven Santmyer \n Category:Novels set in Manhattan \n Category:Novels set in Ohio \n Category:Novels about writers \n Category:American bildungsromans \n Category:Novels set during World War I \n Category:English-language novels \n Category:1925 debut novels", ["Helen Hooven Santmyer", "United States", "English language", "Bildungsroman", "Houghton Mifflin", "Hardcover", "1925 in literature", "novel", "Helen Hooven Santmyer", "Ohio", "Manhattan", "World War I", "pacifism", "Jo March", "Category:1925 American novels", "Category:Novels by Helen Hooven Santmyer", "Category:Novels set in Manhattan", "Category:Novels set in Ohio", "Category:Novels about writers", "Category:American bildungsromans", "Category:Novels set during World War I", "Category:English-language novels", "Category:1925 debut novels"]]

He is also critical of the reuse of the threat of  \" something being brought crashing down to Earth...an overused plot last season \"  and observes that an  \" end of season rematch with Kaarg is unsubtly telegraphed \" . However, he does states that  \" [t]here are some good moments [in  \" Part Two \" ], particularly as Chrissie Jackson gets more character development in one 30-second scene than she had in most of [Series One] \" . < ref name= \" Dreamwatch Part Two \" / > \n \n Holm likens Sarah Jane's gang to Mystery, Inc. from Scooby-Doo and sees Kaagh as  \" a character somewhere between the sadistic Styre from The Sontaran Experiment and General Staal in  \" The Sonataran Stratagem \" . \" < ref name= \" The Sontaran Strategem \" / > < ref name= \" The Sontaran Experiment \" / > < ref name= \" Dreamwatch Part One \" / >  Both Rawson-Jones and Holm view Kaagh's cloaking abilities as a  \" homage \"  to  \" '80s action classic \"  Predator (1987). < ref name= \" Digital Spy Part One \" / > < ref name= \" Dreamwatch Part One \" / > < ref name= \" Predator \" >  < /ref > \n \n ==Novelisation== \n  \n \n This was the seventh of eleven Sarah Jane Adventures serials to be adapted as a novel.

["The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl", "The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl are memoirs of a former London call girl written by Dr. Brooke Magnanti, under the pseudonym Belle de Jour. \n \n From the summer of 2003 to the autumn of 2004 Belle charted her day-to-day adventures on and off the field in a web diary. < ref >  < /ref >  The blogs were then published into the book, in which Belle elaborates on the diary entries and tells of how she became a Call Girl. \n \n  \n \n ==Synopsis== \n The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl begins with Belle de Jour introducing herself as a  \" whore \" , then further explaining that she does not mean it metaphorically, and that she literally is a  \" whore \" . \n \n After the prologue the book begins in a diary format, with Belle explaining the clients she meets and her personal complications that become entwined with her job as a call girl. The average diary entries last little longer than a page and are always titled with the date, which is written in French, for example, the first diary entry reads  \" Samedi, le 1 Novembre \" , which translates into Saturday, 1 November. Each chapter is broken apart by the month the diary entries were written in, for example  \" Novembre \"  (November). \n \n ==People featured in the book== \n *Belle: The writer of The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl. The book focuses primarily on Belle's life. \n *N: An ex-boyfriend of Belle's and her good friend. \n *The manager: Belle's madam, an intelligent woman, fluent in German and Arabic. \n *The Boy: Belle's boyfriend, who is aware of her job as a call girl. \n \n ==Adaptation== \n An adaption was created for ITV2 in 2007 called Secret Diary of a Call Girl. < ref >  < /ref >  The show stars Billie Piper as Belle but also shows her private life and her personal struggles; in the adaptation her real name is Hannah Baxter. The show has since been aired in America by Showtime. < ref >  < /ref > \n \n ===Differences=== \n Some of the characters in Secret Diary of a Call Girl have different personalities from their literary counterparts. N is described as  \" the hub of all gossip \" , < ref >  < /ref >  whereas Ben in Secret Diary of a Call Girl does not seem to share this trait. The manager is described as rather nice, and Belle appears to have a pleasant enough relationship with her, however Stephanie, Belle's madam in Secret Diary, is a cynical woman who often argues with Belle. The Boy appears to have no television equivalent. The closest character to The Boy would be Alex; however the links between the two are somewhat tenuous. The character of Hannah Baxter, who also goes under the pseudonym Belle, remains very close to the original descriptions of Belle de Jour in the books. \n \n ==References== \n  \n \n ==External links== \n * Orion Publishing \n \n  \n \n  \n Category:English non-fiction books \n Category:2005 non-fiction books \n Category:Non-fiction books about British prostitution \n Category:Prostitution in the United Kingdom", ["Belle de Jour (writer)", "Nonfiction", "Erotica", "Orion Publishing", "Hardcover", "Paperback", "London", "call girl", "Belle de Jour (writer)", "blog", "The Times", "metaphor", "diary", "call girl", "Pimp", "Arabic language", "call girl", "ITV2", "Secret Diary of a Call Girl", "Billie Piper", "Hannah Baxter", "Hannah Baxter", "Showtime (TV network)", "Stephanie (Secret Diary of a Call Girl)", "Hannah Baxter", "pseudonym", "Category:English non-fiction books", "Category:2005 non-fiction books", "Category:Non-fiction books about British prostitution", "Category:Prostitution in the United Kingdom"]]
["The Wanderings of Oisin", "The Wanderings of Oisin ( ) is an epic poem published by William Butler Yeats in 1889 in the book The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems. < ref > Yeats 1889 < /ref >  It was his first publication outside magazines, and immediately won him a reputation as a significant poet. < ref > Matthew Russell reviewed the poem in the Irish Monthly (February 1889), stating  \" Ireland can boast of another true poet in William Yeats \" ; quoted in a later Irish Monthly (March 1953) article by Roger McHugh. < /ref >   This narrative poem takes the form of a dialogue between the aged Irish hero Ois\u00edn and St. Patrick, the man traditionally responsible for converting Ireland to Christianity.  Most of the poem is spoken by Oisin, relating his 300-year sojourn in the isles of Faerie. Oisin was not a popular poem with  modernist critics like TS Eliot. < ref > \" The poetry of the young Yeats hardly existed for me until after my enthusiasm had been won by the poetry of the older Yeats.. \"  TS Eliot in The First Annual Yeats Lecture, Dublin 1940, collected in On Poetry  &  Poets, Faber 1957, quoted by John Kelly in his essay Eliot  &  Yeats, Yeats Annual no 20. < /ref >  However, Harold Bloom defended this poem in his book-length study of Yeats, and concludes that it deserves reconsideration. < ref > Bloom, H; Yeats, Oxford University Press, 1970, < /ref > \n \n ==Story== \n thumb|Ossian's Dream by Jean Ingres \n  \n The fairy princess Niamh fell in love with Oisin's poetry and begged him to join her in the immortal islands.  For a hundred years he lived as one of the Sidhe, hunting, dancing, and feasting. At the end of this time he found a spear washed up on the shore and grew sad, remembering his times with the Fenians.  Niamh took him away to another island, where the ancient and abandoned castle of the sea-god Manannan stood. Here they found another woman held captive by a demon, whom Oisin battled again and again for a hundred years, until it was finally defeated. They then went to an island where ancient giants who had grown tired of the world long ago were sleeping until its end, and Niamh and Oisin slept and dreamt with them for a hundred years. Oisin then desired to return to Ireland to see his comrades. Niamh lent him her horse warning him that he must not touch the ground, or he would never return. Back in Ireland, Oisin, still a young man, found his warrior companions dead, and the pagan faith of Ireland displaced by Patrick's Christianity. He then saw two men struggling to carry a  \" sack full of sand \" ; < ref > Yeats 1990: 444 (line 876) < /ref >  he bent down to lift it with one hand and hurl it away for them, but his saddle girth broke and he fell to the ground, becoming three hundred years old instantaneously. \n \n ==Structure== \n The poem is told in three parts, with the verse becoming more complex with each: the lines run four (iambic tetrameter), five (iambic pentameter), and six (anapaestic hexameter) metrical feet respectively.

["State of Change", "State of Change is an original novel written by Christopher Bulis and based on the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who. The novel features the Sixth Doctor and Peri, although the dimensional instability of the realm they are currently visiting causes the Doctor to briefly regress through his first five incarnations; the Sixth Doctor also spends a great deal of time allowing the personality of the Third Doctor to take control of his body when he is forced to fight. \n \n ==Plot== \n 10 BC. The Doctor and Peri land in ancient Rome, specifically in the tomb of Cleopatra. But something is very wrong: The tomb walls depict steam-driven galleys and other disturbing anachronisms. The time travellers discover that Rome has advanced far beyond its natural means, and they must recruit the aid of Ptolemy Caesar to prevent his half-siblings, Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene II, from waging a potentially world-ending war with each other. But the anomalies don't just end with Rome, as The Doctor and Peri experience changes of their own... \n \n ==Continuity== \n It is implied at the end of the novel, when the Dominion is transported to a newly created duplicate of Earth in a distant star system, that this is the same planet as Mondas - the eventual home of the Cybermen. \n \n ==External links== \n *The Cloister Library - State of Change \n *State of Change in the TARDIS Data Core \n \n  \n  \n \n Category:1994 British novels \n Category:1994 science fiction novels \n Category:Virgin Missing Adventures \n Category:Sixth Doctor novels \n Category:Novels by Christopher Bulis \n Category:The Rani (Doctor Who) stories \n Category:Novels set in ancient Rome \n Category:Novels set in the 1st century BC", ["Christopher Bulis", "Doctor Who", "Virgin Missing Adventures", "Sixth Doctor", "Peri Brown", "Revelation of the Daleks", "The Trial of a Time Lord", "Virgin Books", "The Crystal Bucephalus", "The Romance of Crime", "Christopher Bulis", "science fiction on television", "Doctor Who", "Sixth Doctor", "Peri Brown", "Third Doctor", "Cleopatra", "Caesarion", "Alexander Helios", "Cleopatra Selene II", "Mondas", "Cybermen", "Category:1994 British novels", "Category:1994 science fiction novels", "Category:Virgin Missing Adventures", "Category:Sixth Doctor novels", "Category:Novels by Christopher Bulis", "Category:The Rani (Doctor Who) stories", "Category:Novels set in ancient Rome", "Category:Novels set in the 1st century BC"]]
["Shadow Country", "Shadow Country is a novel by Peter Matthiessen, published by Random House in 2008. Subtitled A New Rendering of the Watson Legend, it is a semi-fictional account of the life of Scottish-American Edgar  \" Bloody \"  Watson (1855\u20131910), a real Florida sugar cane planter and alleged outlaw who was killed by a posse of his neighbors in the remote Ten Thousand Islands region of southwest Florida. \n \n Matthiessen revised, condensed, and combined his three previously published novels about Edgar Watson to create this single-volume novel, which is divided into three sections that comform to the three original books. Shadow Country won the National Book Award for Fiction in 2008 < ref name=nba2008 > \n  \" National Book Awards \u2013 2008 \" . National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-09. (With interview, acceptance speech by Matthiessen, and essay by Harold Augenbraum from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.) < /ref > \n and the William Dean Howells Medal in 2010. \n \n ==Contents== \n Shadow Country is a reworked, re-edited, and retitled single-volume version of a trilogy published in the 1990s. The three parts of this book correspond to the three original novels: Killing Mr. Watson (1990), Lost Man's River (1997), and Bone By Bone (1999). \n \n Matthiesen's original intention was to produce a single long novel, but his publisher balked at the length of the manuscript and published it as three separate books. Matthiessen was not entirely satisfied with the resulting works and continued to refine his original manuscript off and on for the next several years. The eventual publication of Shadow Country involved substantial editing and culling: while the three separately published books together numbered some 1,300 pages, Shadow Country would number around 900. Most of the cuts came from Lost Man's River. < ref name= \" LeClair \" >  < /ref > \n \n thumb|left|The landing behind the Ted Smallwood Store in Chokoloskee, Florida, site of Edgar Watson's death in Shadow Country and in real life \n Book One is based on Killing Mr. Watson and is a collection of first-person narrative accounts of Edgar  \" Bloody \"  Watson's rise to power and eventual death at the hands of his neighbors. The book opens with Watson's death - his shooting by a local posse on the shores of Chokoloskee Island behind the Ted Smallwood Store. The rest of the book pieces together first-person accounts of 12 characters who recount the story from Watson's arrival in the Ten Thousand Islands in the early 1890s until his demise in 1910. Many of the  \" characters \"  who tell the story are based on real people who lived in the area at the time. \n \n Book Two is based on Lost Man's River. It is set several years after Book One, and it tells the story of Lucius, one of Watson's sons and an alcoholic historian, who tries to reconstruct his father's life in an attempt to determine whether he was really a murderer and an outlaw. It is written as a third person narrative. \n \n Book Three is based on Bone By Bone. In this first-person section, Edgar Watson tells his own life story, from his childhood in South Carolina to his fatal encounter with his neighbors on the edge of the Florida Everglades. By using this chronology, Matthiessen ends the book with the same scene in which it began told from opposite points of view. \n \n ==Reception== \n Michael Dirda was one of many critics who lavished praise on the work: \n \n < blockquote > Shadow Country is altogether gripping, shocking, and brilliantly told, not just a tour de force in its stylistic range, but a  \" Great American Novel, \"  as powerful a reading experience as nearly any in our literature. This magnificent, sad masterpiece about race, history, and defeated dreams can easily stand comparison with Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man and Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men. Little wonder, too, that parts of the story of E.J. Watson call up comparisons with Dostoevsky, Conrad, and, inevitably, Faulkner. In every way, Shadow Country is a bravura performance, at once history, fiction, and myth\u2014as well as the capstone to the career of one of the most admired and admirable writers of our time. < ref > Dirda, Michael  \" An Epic of the Everglades \" , The New York Review of Books, May 15, 2008. < /ref > < /blockquote > \n \n Tom LeClair, reviewing the work for the New York Times, considered that the work failed to live up to the sum total of its originally published parts, stating: \n \n < blockquote > By reducing his Watson materials to one volume, Matthiessen has sacrificed qualities that gave those novels their powerful reinforcing illusions of authenticity and artlessness. Book I still has that Ten Thousand Islands quality, but  \" Shadow Country \"  as a whole is like the Tamiami Trail that crosses the Everglades. It offers a quicker and easier passage through the swamp, but fewer shades and shadows. < ref name= \" LeClair \"  / > < /blockquote > \n \n Tampa Bay Times book editor Colette Bancroft praised the book's wider theme and context: \n \n  \n \n ==References== \n  \n \n ==Reviews== \n * \" A History of Violence \"  at The New York Times \n * \" 'Shadow Country' by Peter Matthiessen \"  at The Los Angeles Times \n * \" An Epic of the Everglades \"  at The New York Review of Books \n * \" Shadow Country: A New Rendering of the Watson Legend \"  at Orion Magazine \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n Category:National Book Award for Fiction winning works \n Category:2008 American novels \n Category:Novels set in Florida \n Category:Southern Gothic novels \n Category:Novels set in the historical United States \n Category:Biographical novels", ["Peter Matthiessen", "Historical fiction", "Southern Gothic", "Modern Library", "audiobook", "ebook", "National Book Award for Fiction", "Peter Matthiessen", "Random House", "Fiction#Semi-fiction", "Scottish-American", "Edgar Watson#Edgar Watson", "sugar cane", "Planter (American South)", "Posse comitatus", "Ten Thousand Islands", "southwest Florida", "National Book Award for Fiction", "National Book Foundation", "William Dean Howells Medal", "trilogy", "New York Times", "File:Smallwood store.JPG", "Ted Smallwood Store", "Chokoloskee, Florida", "first-person narrative", "Chokoloskee Island", "Ted Smallwood Store", "Narration#Third-person", "South Carolina", "Everglades", "Michael Dirda", "Great American Novel", "Ralph Ellison", "Robert Penn Warren", "Dostoevsky", "Joseph Conrad", "William Faulkner", "The New York Review of Books", "Tom LeClair", "New York Times", "Tampa Bay Times", "The New York Times", "The Los Angeles Times", "The New York Review of Books", "Orion (magazine)", "Tree of Smoke", "Denis Johnson", "National Book Award for Fiction", "Let the Great World Spin", "Colum McCann", "Category:National Book Award for Fiction winning works", "Category:2008 American novels", "Category:Novels set in Florida", "Category:Southern Gothic novels", "Category:Novels set in the historical United States", "Category:Biographical novels"]]

Retrieved 2012-01-15 < /ref >   The book's publication led to the formation of a consultancy, called Playmaker Systems, LLC, and a series of self-service and for-pay web-tools and apps that further explicate the decision support system. \n \n == Overview == \n \n In the text, Kelly breaks down the most basic units of influence, called influence stratagems \u2013 colloquially referred to as \u201cplays\u201d \u2013 which practitioners of influence employ for mutual and competitive advantage.  According to Kelly, plays underlie all aspects of the influence industries \u2013 examples being marketing, public affairs, public relations, information warfare, IO/MISO, psy ops, law, diplomacy, politics, sales, positioning, and rhetorical debate \u2013 and are employed regardless of skill-set and discipline. \n \n The Elements of Influence presents the Standard Table of Influence, a classification of the units of influence into an ontology.  The Standard Table of Influence consists of 25 irreducibly unique influence stratagems (since revised down to 24, see below), organized by a three-class and eight-subclass superstructure.  The table's concise organization into a stable decision-support system for influence has led some practitioners to refer to it as \u201cthe Rosetta Stone of influence.\u201d < ref name= \" elements \" > Kelly, Alan.

["The Forgotten (Applegate novel)", "The Forgotten is the 11th book in the Animorphs series, written by K.A. Applegate. It is narrated by Jake. \n \n ==Plot summary== \n Jake spends a day having strange flashbacks of himself in a rainforest, which leaves him disturbed. \n \n That evening, after watching a boxing match with his brother and father, he leaves for a grocery store, where Tobias has discovered something  has crashed and the high-ranking Yeerks are trying to hide it. The other Animorphs join them, and together they infiltrate the store in fly morph. Cassie overhears Chapman saying that it was a Yeerk Bug Fighter. After Ax manages to reconfigure the ship's controls, the Animorphs escape, pursued by Chapman and the other Yeerks. They plan to fly the spacecraft to Washington, in order to convince the American government that Earth is under attack by extraterrestrials. When  Ax discovers that the fighter's technology to keep human radar from seeing it is broken, they are intercepted by two U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jets, however, Cassie notices that they are over the Red Sea in the Middle East - far from their intended destination. Flying above the atmosphere, they are picked up by Visser Three's Blade ship's sensors. The Animorphs, knowing they can't escape, try to fire on the Visser's vessel. Both Jake and the Blade ship fire their Dracon beams at the same time, and, coincidentally, their projectiles intersect, and both ships crash. \n \n The kids wake up in their wrecked Bug Fighter. They look around, noticing that they've crash-landed in a rainforest. They assume they're in the Amazon rainforest, but are also disturbed by the fact that it is the middle of the day (whereas it was nighttime in the United States, which is in roughly the same time zone as South America). After Jake reveals the strange flashbacks he was having, Ax speculates they may have caused a  \" Sario Rip \"  and traveled twelve hours backwards through time, which would explain why Jake was having strange flashbacks: he was in two places at once, and the two Jakes---the  \" past \"  and  \" future \"  versions---experience each other's thoughts at random moments. However, Cassie later notices that only Jake has the flashes so Ax says that Jake is the only  \" real \"  person - the rest are just a memory. \n \n They soon find that the Yeerks have traveled backwards through time as well, and will need both ships to create another Sario Rip and return to the right time. Ax takes the Bug Fighter's computer to prevent them from doing so, and the group ventures out into the hostile wilderness, constantly plagued by insects, fire ants, snakes and piranhas. They're pursued by the Yeerks, who ruthlessly destroy the animals and trees around them in a bid to kill the Animorphs, desperate to retrieve the precious computer. The children acquire jaguar and monkey morphs in order to traverse the rainforest more easily. \n \n They eventually stumble across a group of Amazon Indians, led by Polo, their tribal chief. Marco, who knows some Spanish, manages to roughly translate the natives' Portuguese, and Jake and Polo agree to assist one another in eliminating the Yeerks. Polo and his men kill the Hork-Bajir guarding the Blade ship with poison-tipped spears, leaving the Animorphs with Visser Three, who morphs an amphibian-like Lerdethak and picks the Animorphs off one by one. Jake morphs into a monkey to use the Lerdethak's vine like arms to move himself to Visser Three's body. He then throws a poison-tipped spear into Visser Three; while never revealed, this may have been fatal. Regardless, Visser Three is still able to use an arm to break Jake's neck.  However, Jake wakes up back at the grocery store, just as they are about to infiltrate it. He calls off the operation, and the Animorphs all go home. \n \n The next day, Jake asks Ax what had happened. Ax postulates that the travel through time created two separate versions of Jake. The reason Jake simply  \" woke up \"  back at the grocery store was that the Jake in the rainforest died at the hands of Visser Three; since it is impossible for one consciousness to exist in two separate locations, when one was eliminated the two snapped back together. Ax also speculates that Jake had to die, or else both Jakes and both their universes would collide and cease to exist. The events in the rainforest never actually happened (including the acquisition of jaguar and monkey morphs), and only remain in Jake's memory. He is left with a feeling of chilling relief. \n \n == Morphs == \n    Morpher \n  Morphs acquired \n  Morphs used \n   Jake \n  Spider monkey < nowiki > * < /nowiki > , jaguar < nowiki > * < /nowiki > \n  Peregrine falcon, housefly, Siberian tiger, spider monkey, jaguar \n   Rachel \n  Spider monkey < nowiki > * < /nowiki > , jaguar < nowiki > * < /nowiki > \n  Bald eagle, housefly, grizzly bear, spider monkey, jaguar \n   Cassie \n  Spider monkey < nowiki > * < /nowiki > , jaguar < nowiki > * < /nowiki > \n  Osprey, housefly, wolf, spider monkey, jaguar \n   Marco \n  Spider monkey < nowiki > * < /nowiki > , jaguar < nowiki > * < /nowiki > \n  Osprey, housefly, wolf, spider monkey, jaguar \n   Ax \n  Spider monkey < nowiki > * < /nowiki > , jaguar < nowiki > * < /nowiki > \n  Housefly, spider monkey, jaguar \n   Visser Three \n  Constrictor snake < nowiki > * < /nowiki > \n  Constrictor snake, Lerdethak \n  \n \n < nowiki > * < /nowiki >  Due to the Sario Rip effect, none of these morphs are usable. \n \n  \n \n  \n Category:Animorphs books \n Category:1997 American novels \n Category:1997 science fiction novels \n Category:Novels about multiple time paths \n Category:Novels set in South America", ["Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels", "Wikipedia:WikiProject Books", "jaguar", "K.

["Northanger Abbey", "Northanger Abbey () is a coming-of-age novel and a satire of Gothic novels < ref >  < /ref >  written by Jane Austen. Austen was also influenced by Charlotte Lennox's The Female Quixote (1752). Northanger Abbey was completed in 1803, the first of Austen's novels completed in full, but was published posthumously in 1817 with Persuasion. < ref name=  \" JASNA \" >  < /ref >  The story concerns Catherine Morland, the na\u00efve young protagonist, and her journey to a better understanding of herself and of the world around her. < ref >  < /ref > < ref >  < /ref >  How Catherine views the world has been distorted by her fondness for Gothic novels and an active imagination. \n \n ==Plot summary== \n Seventeen-year-old Catherine Morland is one of ten children of a country clergyman. Although a tomboy in her childhood, by the age of 17 she is  \" in training for a heroine \"  and is fond of reading Gothic novels,  \" provided they were all story and no reflection \" . \n \n Catherine is invited by the Allens (her wealthier neighbours in Fullerton) to accompany them to visit the city of Bath and partake in the winter season of balls, theatre and other social delights. Soon she is introduced to a clever young gentleman, Henry Tilney, with whom she dances and converses. Through Mrs. Allen's old schoolfriend Mrs. Thorpe, she meets her daughter Isabella, who introduces Catherine to Ann Radcliffe's Mysteries of Udolpho, and the two quickly become friends. Mrs. Thorpe's son, John, is also a friend of Catherine's older brother, James, at Oxford where they are both students. \n \n The Thorpes are not happy about Catherine's friendship with the Tilneys, as they correctly perceive Henry as a rival for Catherine's affections, though Catherine is not at all interested in the crude John Thorpe. Catherine tries to maintain her friendships with both the Thorpes and the Tilneys, though John Thorpe continuously tries to sabotage her relationship with the Tilneys. This leads to several misunderstandings, which put Catherine in the awkward position of having to explain herself to the Tilneys. \n \n Isabella and James become engaged. James' father approves of the match and offers his son a country parson's living of a modest sum, \u00a3400 annually, but they must wait until he can obtain the benefice in two and a half years. Isabella is dissatisfied, but to Catherine, she misrepresents her distress as being caused solely by the delay, and not by the value of the sum. Isabella immediately begins to flirt with Captain Tilney, Henry's older brother. Innocent Catherine cannot understand her friend's behaviour, but Henry understands all too well, as he knows his brother's character and habits. \n \n The Tilneys invite Catherine to stay with them for a few weeks at their home, Northanger Abbey. Catherine, in accordance with her novel reading, expects the abbey to be exotic and frightening. Henry teases her about this, as it turns out that Northanger Abbey is pleasant and decidedly not Gothic. However, the house includes a mysterious suite of rooms that no one ever enters; Catherine learns that they were the apartments of Mrs. Tilney, who died nine years earlier. As General Tilney no longer appears to be ill-affected by her death, Catherine decides that he may have murdered her or even imprisoned her in her chamber. \n \n Catherine discovers that her over-active imagination has led her astray, as nothing is strange or distressing in the apartments. Unfortunately, Henry questions her; he surmises, and informs her that his father loved his wife in his own way and was truly upset by her death. < ref name= \" Gutenberg \" >  < /ref >  She leaves, crying, fearing that she has lost Henry's regard entirely. Realising how foolish she has been, Catherine comes to believe that, though novels may be delightful, their content does not relate to everyday life. Henry does not mention this incident to her again. \n \n James writes to inform her that he has broken off his engagement to Isabella and that she has become engaged instead to Captain Tilney. Henry and Eleanor Tilney are sceptical that their brother has actually become engaged to Isabella Thorpe. Catherine is terribly disappointed, realising what a dishonest person Isabella is. A subsequent letter from Isabella herself confirms the Tilney siblings' doubts, and shows that Frederick Tilney was merely flirting with Isabella. The General goes off to London, and the atmosphere at Northanger Abbey immediately becomes lighter and pleasanter for his absence. Catherine passes several enjoyable days with Henry and Eleanor until, in Henry's absence, the General returns abruptly, in a temper. He forces Catherine to go home early the next morning, in a shocking, inhospitable, and unsafe move that forces Catherine to undertake the  journey alone. \n \n At home, Catherine is listless and unhappy. Henry pays a sudden unexpected visit and explains what happened. General Tilney (on the misinformation of John Thorpe) had believed her to be exceedingly rich as the Allens' prospective heiress, and therefore a proper match for Henry. In London, General Tilney ran into Thorpe again, who, angry and petty at Catherine's refusal of his half-made proposal of marriage, said instead that she was nearly destitute. Enraged, General Tilney, (again on the misinformation of John Thorpe), returned home to evict Catherine. When Henry returned to Northanger, his father informed him of what had occurred and forbade him to think of Catherine again. When Henry learns how she had been treated, he breaks with his father and tells Catherine he still wants to marry her despite his father's disapproval. Catherine is delighted, though when Henry seeks her parents' approval, they tell the young couple that final approval will only happen when General Tilney consents. \n \n Eventually, General Tilney acquiesces, because Eleanor has become engaged to a wealthy and titled man; and he discovers that the Morlands, while not extremely rich, are far from destitute. \n \n ==Characters== \n thumb|Catherine Morland in an illustration from an 1833 edition of the novel \n Catherine Morland: The naive 17-year-old protagonist of the novel, Catherine lacks life experience, but is determined to see the best in people. Her appearance is  \" pleasing, and when in good looks, pretty. \" < ref >  < /ref >  Her fondness for Gothic novels and an active imagination can skew her interpretation of real events. She has a sweet and good-natured personality and is observant but na\u00efve, not seeing malicious underlying intentions in people's actions until the end of the novel.

Northanger Abbey, however, being chronologically the first novel completed by Austen (though revised later in her life), and notably considered a  \" point of departure \"  from her other work as a result of the  \" boldness with which it flaunts its . . . deceptive air of simplicity with broad, bold humour \" . < ref name= \" Lascelles, Mary 1963 \" > Lascelles, Mary. Jane Austen and Her Art. Oxford University Press, 1963. < /ref > \n \n === Love, marriage and high society ===  \n When Catherine enters Bath, she is rather unaware of the societal setting she will encounter. The text notes that her mother, also, knew little of high society, < ref name= \" Lascelles, Mary 1963 \" / >  which explains why Austen pairs Catherine with the Allens, who are higher ranked in society than she, due to their wealth. Society greatly influences partner selection, especially in Northanger Abbey, as General Tilney, for example, disapproves of Henry and Catherine's love due to their disparity in wealth. General Tilney only accepts Henry and Catherine's marriage after Eleanor Tilney becomes engaged to a wealthy man. < ref > Austen, Jane. Northanger Abbey. Edited by Janet Todd, Cambridge University Press, 2006. < /ref >  Further, Catherine distances herself from John Thorpe, though he is societally deemed a  \" good \"  match for her. Rather, Catherine bravely situates love and companionship as more worthy than standing and rank, unlike Isabella, who ends the novel with two broken engagements. \n \n === Life lived as in a Gothic novel === \n Though Austen greatly encourages the reading of novels to her readers, Catherine must learn to separate life from fiction, and rein in her very active imagination. When Catherine accuses General Tilney of murdering or locking up his wife, she is humiliated when it is discovered to be untrue, as Henry chastises her, by saying:  \" 'You had formed a surmise of such horror as I have hardly words to\u2014 Dear Miss Morland, consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained. What have you been judging from?' \" < ref name= \" Northanger \" > Austen, Jane. Jane Austen\u2019s Northanger Abbey. Edited by Marilyn Gaull, Pearson/Longman, 2005. < /ref >  Upon this, Catherine is mortified, and distraught at the notion that Henry would think less of her for her wild assumptions. When reflecting, Catherine identifies that she must separate Gothic novels from her judgement of everyday life. This serves as a major progression in the novel, as it is a sign of Catherine's maturation and ability to appreciate novels without immediately applying them to her behaviour and thoughts. \n \n === Bildungsroman ===  \n While Catherine controls her imagination, she simultaneously endures the reality of individuals not behaving in the manner they should. Most prominently, Catherine realizes she is not to rely upon others, such as Isabella, who are negatively influential on her, but to be single-minded and independent. Isabella, regardless of her engagement to James Morland, flirts with Frederick Tilney, breaks her engagement to James, is discarded by Frederick, and causes herself great shame. Catherine began to realize the wrongs of Isabella's influence when the Thorpes cause her to miss her appointment with Henry and Eleanor Tilney early on, < ref name= \" Northanger \"  / >  but it is not until the shocking wrongdoing against her brother that Catherine entirely separates herself from their friendship, stating that she may never speak to Isabella again, and is not as upset as she thought she would be. < ref name= \" Northanger \"  / >  As this scene takes place almost immediately after Catherine's lesson about Gothic novels, it is a clear sign of her increasing maturity. \n \n === The value of reading === \n In one of Austen's narrator's boldest proclamations, the narrator of Northanger Abbey exclaims upon the significance of reading novels, writing:  \" I will not adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel-writers, of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances, to the number of which they are themselves adding\u2014joining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works, and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine, who, if she accidentally take up a novel, is sure to turn over its insipid pages with disgust. Alas! If the heroine of one novel be not patronized by the heroine of another, from whom can she expect protection and regard? I cannot approve of it \" . < ref name= \" Northanger \"  / >  In this famous moment, Austen's narrator acknowledges the hypocrisy in insulting those who read novels. It is also made clear in this text that those who are considered  \" good \"  and well-educated read novels, such as Henry and Eleanor Tilney. John Thorpe, for example, who does not read novels, < ref name= \" Northanger \"  / >  is the cad of the text. Furthermore, there is a distinction made between Catherine's imagination and childishness that encourages her fantasy of a murderous General Tilney, rather than it being a direct fault of the novel genre. \n \n === The importance of time === \n Various scholars such as the French historian Michel Foucault and the British Marxist E.P. Thompson have argued the 18th century become the  \" era of the clock \"  as availability of mass-produced clocks and watches allowed time to be measured more accurately, leading to an increased emphasis on doing things on time that not existed before, marking the beginning of  \" time discipline \"  as Thompson called it. < ref > Kickel, Katherine  \" General Tilney\u2019s Timely Approach to the Improvement of the Estate in Jane Austen\u2019s Northanger Abbey \"  pages 145-169 from Nineteenth-Century Literature, Volume 63, No. 2, September 2008 page 147. < /ref >  In what is seen as example of the new era of  \" time discipline \" , Austen frequently used clocks as symbol of General Tilney's authority over Northanger Abbey. < ref > Kickel, Katherine  \" General Tilney\u2019s Timely Approach to the Improvement of the Estate in Jane Austen\u2019s Northanger Abbey \"  pages 145-169 from Nineteenth-Century Literature, Volume 63, No. 2, September 2008 page 148. < /ref >  Throughout the novel, General Tilney is checking his watch, and is most insistent that servants and his own family observe the clocks to see if they are doing things on time. < ref > Kickel, Katherine  \" General Tilney\u2019s Timely Approach to the Improvement of the Estate in Jane Austen\u2019s Northanger Abbey \"  pages 145-169 from Nineteenth-Century Literature, Volume 63, No. 2, September 2008 page 150. < /ref >  During her time in Bath, Catherine had easy-going attitude to time, having no strict schedule and planning nothing in advance. < ref > Kickel, Katherine  \" General Tilney\u2019s Timely Approach to the Improvement of the Estate in Jane Austen\u2019s Northanger Abbey \"  pages 145-169 from Nineteenth-Century Literature, Volume 63, No. 2, September 2008 page 151. < /ref > \n \n It is only after Catherine meets Henry Tilney that the novel begins to speak of the importance of time, with Catherine having to check the clocks to see if she will be on time to meet him. < ref > Kickel, Katherine  \" General Tilney\u2019s Timely Approach to the Improvement of the Estate in Jane Austen\u2019s Northanger Abbey \"  pages 145-169 from Nineteenth-Century Literature, Volume 63, No. 2, September 2008 page 152. < /ref >  However, after arriving at Northanger Abbey, Catherine discovers that General Tilney is constantly checking his watch and that everything at the abbey happens on a strict schedule, which is a marked difference from Catherine's lax attitude that she displayed in Bath. < ref > Kickel, Katherine  \" General Tilney\u2019s Timely Approach to the Improvement of the Estate in Jane Austen\u2019s Northanger Abbey \"  pages 145-169 from Nineteenth-Century Literature, Volume 63, No. 2, September 2008 page 153. < /ref >  When Catherine is late to a dinner, General Tilney shows his displeasure by pacing back and forth in the dining room while frequently glancing at the clock. < ref > Kickel, Katherine  \" General Tilney\u2019s Timely Approach to the Improvement of the Estate in Jane Austen\u2019s Northanger Abbey \"  pages 145-169 from Nineteenth-Century Literature, Volume 63, No. 2, September 2008 page 154. < /ref >  Because of the importance of staying on schedule, even when General Tilney is not around, clocks serve as a symbol of his power as Catherine finds herself checking what time it is all the time. < ref > Kickel, Katherine  \" General Tilney\u2019s Timely Approach to the Improvement of the Estate in Jane Austen\u2019s Northanger Abbey \"  pages 145-169 from Nineteenth-Century Literature, Volume 63, No. 2, September 2008 page 155. < /ref > \n \n As the novel progresses, Catherine finds the discipline imposed by the clocks more and more oppressive, as she finds that she is living her life according to General Tilney's dictates and demands. < ref > Kickel, Katherine  \" General Tilney\u2019s Timely Approach to the Improvement of the Estate in Jane Austen\u2019s Northanger Abbey \"  pages 145-169 from Nineteenth-Century Literature, Volume 63, No. 2, September 2008 page 155 < /ref >  Catherine compares General Tilney to a clock, as something inhuman and mechanical that operates with no regard to the human body. < ref > Kickel, Katherine  \" General Tilney\u2019s Timely Approach to the Improvement of the Estate in Jane Austen\u2019s Northanger Abbey \"  pages 145-169 from Nineteenth-Century Literature, Volume 63, No. 2, September 2008 page 156 < /ref >  At one point, when Catherine receives a letter from her brother, she allows herself  \" half a hour\u2019s free indulgence of grief and reflection \"  before composing herself for dinner all the while watching the clock. When Catherine visits the kitchen, she notes that it is equipped with all manner of  \" modern \"  cooking equipment and that the cooks worked in an efficient manner like soldiers performing a drill, which reflects the General's wish to have everything ordered. Likewise, General Tilney's ownership of a glasshouse that allows rare tropical fruit like pineapples to be grown in England was a sign that he was extremely rich as only those in the highest income brackets could afford a glasshouse, which was a symbol of luxury in Regency England. \n \n ==Publication== \n \n Austen initially sold the novel, then titled Susan, for \u00a310 to a London bookseller, Crosby  &  Co. in 1803. This publisher did not print the work but held on to the manuscript. < ref name= \" JASNA \"  / >  Austen reportedly threatened to take her work back from them, but Crosby  &  Co responded that she would face legal consequences for reclaiming her text. < ref >  < /ref >  In the spring of 1816, the bookseller sold it back to the novelist's brother, Henry Austen, for the same sum as they had paid for it. There is evidence that Austen further revised the novel in 1816\u20131817 with the intention of having it published. She rewrote sections, renaming the main character Catherine and using that as her working title. \n \n After her death, Austen's brother Henry gave the novel its final name and arranged for publication of Northanger Abbey in late December 1817 (1818 given on the title page), as the first two volumes of a four-volume set, with a preface for the first time publicly identifying Jane Austen as the author of all her novels. Neither Northanger Abbey nor Persuasion was published under the working title Jane Austen used. Aside from first being published together, the two novels are not connected; later editions were published separately. \n \n == Reputation == \n  \n \n Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, published together posthumously in December 1817, were reviewed in the British Critic in March 1818 and in the Edinburgh Review and Literary Miscellany in May 1818. The reviewer for the British Critic felt that Austen's exclusive dependence on realism was evidence of a deficient imagination. The reviewer for the Edinburgh Review disagreed, praising Austen for her  \" exhaustless invention \"  and the combination of the familiar and the surprising in her plots. < ref > Waldron, 89. < /ref >   \n \n Austen scholars have pointed out that these early reviewers did not know what to make of her novels\u2014for example, they misunderstood her use of irony. Reviewers, for example, reduced Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice to didactic tales of virtue prevailing over vice. < ref > Waldron, 84\u201385, 87\u201388. < /ref > \n \n == Satire  == \n === Gothic novel, etc. === \n Northanger Abbey is fundamentally a parody of Gothic fiction, which was especially popular during the 1790s and at the turn of the nineteenth century. < ref name= \" JASNA \" / >  Austen upends the conventions of eighteenth-century novels by making her heroine a plain and undistinguished girl from a middle-class family, allowing the heroine to fall in love with the hero before he has a serious thought of her, and exposing the heroine's romantic fears and curiosities as groundless. However, the British critic Robert Irvine wrote that though Catherine's specific fears that General Tilney murdered his wife are false, the book ends with her general fears of him being confirmed as his character is indeed vicious as the book says:  \" Catherine, at any rate, heard enough to feel, that in suspecting General Tilney of either murdering or shutting up his wife, she had scarcely sinned against his character, or magnified his cruelty \" . < ref > Irvine, Robert Jane Austen, London: Routledge, 2005 page 48. < /ref >  Likewise, the scholar Rachel Brownstein observed that Catherine's fears of General Tilney are in substance correct, though the book notes he turns out be a  \" villain of common life \" , not that of romance. < ref name= \" Brownstein pages 32-57 \" > Brownstein, Rachel  \" Northanger Abbey, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice \"  pages 32-57 from The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997 page 40. < /ref >  Brownstein wrote that the conclusion the book invites is:  \" ...our heroine's instincts were good guides to truth\u2014perhaps even that they were good because they were informed by Gothic novels about vulnerable women persecuted by powerful men \" . < ref name= \" Brownstein pages 32-57 \" / > \n \n Irvine also points out that though parts of the book do satirize the Gothic novels popular in the 18th century, the interpretation of the novel as completely a satire of the Gothic genre is problematic. < ref name= \" Irvine, Robert page 43 \" > Irvine, Robert Jane Austen, London: Routledge, 2005 page 43. < /ref >  Irvine points out that, except in book II, the problems faced by Catherine are not caused by her reading Gothic novels, nor is Catherine's rejection of romantic love following Henry's outburst the climax, but instead is followed by Catherine being summarily expelled from Northanger Abbey after General Tilney discovers that she is not rich as he had been led to believe. < ref name= \" Irvine, Robert page 43 \" / >  Irvine observed that for Catherine her expulsion is a traumatic event that is equal in its emotional impact to the horrors that she had imagined General Tilney committing. < ref name= \" Irvine, Robert page 43 \" / >  Irvine also notes that the first chapters in the novel satirize the novels of Maria Edgeworth and Frances Burney, whom the novel ostensibly praises, as it does the Gothic novels. < ref name= \" Irvine, Robert page 43 \" / >  An early sign that Henry Tilney is the hero while John Thorpe is not can be seen in the fact that the former likes to read books while the latter does not. < ref name= \" Brownstein pages 32-57 \" / > \n \n Austen was also influenced by The Female Quixote; or, The Adventures of Arabella (1752) a novel by Charlotte Lennox that was an imitation and parody of Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote. It was approved by both Henry Fielding and Samuel Richardson, and applauded by Samuel Johnson. < ref >  < /ref >   \n \n The story begins with the narrator remarking that the heroine is not really a heroine, with the narrator saying Catherine was not especially clever, nor a great beauty, and good without being virtuous. < ref name= \" Irvine, Robert page 41 \" > Irvine, Robert Jane Austen, London: Routledge, 2005 page 41. < /ref >  The narrator goes to say the reader was expecting the heroine to be very virtuous, clever, and striking beautiful, which makes Catherine a  \" strange, unaccountable character! \" < ref name= \" Irvine, Robert page 41 \" / >  Only with the second chapter does the narrator have anything positive to say about Catherine, which are even then still qualified by attaching the adjectives  \" remarkable \"  and extraordinary \" , which is only meant ironically as what the narrator calls the  \" extraordinary \"  traits of Catherine are in fact quite ordinary, which seems to be Austen's way of satirizing how women were portrayed in contemporary literature. < ref name= \" Irvine, Robert page 41 \" / >  Austen's point appears to be what there is a gulf between how women really are and how they are portrayed in novels. < ref name= \" Irvine, Robert page 41 \" / >  The point is further emphasized by satirizing Richardson's rule laid out in The Rambler  \" that no young lady can be justified in falling in love before the gentleman\u2019s love is declared \" , which Catherine breaks without suffering. < ref name= \" Irvine, Robert page 42 \" > Irvine, Robert Jane Austen, London: Routledge, 2005 page 42. < /ref >  Later, when Catherine is feeling depressed, her mother tries unsuccessfully to cheer her up by having her read The Mirror (a popular journal in the late 18th century), which seems to be Austen's way of saying that what the moralising journals have to say is not applicable in real life. < ref name= \" Irvine, Robert page 42 \" / > \n \n A reviewer in 2016 said  \" Austen\u2019s Northanger Abbey was in part a playful response to what she considered  \" unnatural \"  in the novels of her day: Instead of perfect heroes, heroines and villains, she offers flawed, rounded characters who behave naturally and not just according to the demands of the plot. \" < ref name=Baker2016 / > \n \n ===  Masculine power: Johnson, Richardson, Blair and Addison === \n \n At one point when Catherine uses the word  \" nice \"  in a way that Henry disapproves of, she is warned:  \" The word 'nicest', as you use it, did not suit him; and you had better change it as soon as you can, or you shall be overpowered with Johnson and Blair all the rest of the way \" . < ref name= \" Irvine, Robert page 42 \" / >  The popular 18th-century arbiters of style and taste such as Johnson, Richardson, Blair and Addison are presented as a canon of masculine power, which the novel is competition with at least as much as the Gothic novels, that were so popular with young women at the time. < ref name= \" Irvine, Robert page 42 \" / >  Irvine wrote that the way in which Henry frequently quotes these authors show he is just as much trapped in the world of the essays laying out rules of conduct and style as Catherine is influenced by the Gothic novels she loves to read. < ref name= \" Irvine, Robert page 42 \" / >  When Henry tries to dissuade Catherine of her Gothic-inspired notions that General Tilney is a murderer, he cites the (male) authors of the essays that were so influential in establishing rules of proper conduct, in short, is trying to dismiss one genre that was popular with women, with another genre that was popular with men. < ref name= \" Irvine, Robert page 42 \" / >  Irvine wrote that:  \" The fact that the Gothic (and perhaps the novel in general) provides a means whereby young women can think for themselves is perhaps the real threat that Henry is countering here. After all, as we have seen, Catherine\u2019s fantasy proves to be a way of imagining as evil a truth about the General that Henry never criticises: the absolute nature of patriarchal power. The type of language that Henry uses does not originate with him: it is borrowed from the essays of Johnson, Blair and company, and gets its authority, its power over Catherine, from that masculine source \" . < ref name= \" Irvine, Robert page 42 \" / >  Irvine contended that the discourse of the essays was a  \" linguistic version of the patriarchal power of the General \" , as a way of imposing power over women, not by locking them up in a room, but imposing a type of language that limits what one may think or not. < ref > Irvine, Robert Jane Austen, London: Routledge, 2005 pages 44-45. < /ref >  In this sense, Henry speaks either with his  \" natural tone \"  when he is being himself and his  \" affected \"  tone, where he uses the discourse of a Johnsonian essay, which mirrors the description at the beginning of the book between the narrator's ideal heroine and Catherine. < ref name= \" Irvine, Robert page 45 \" > Irvine, Robert Jane Austen, London: Routledge, 2005 page 45. < /ref > \n \n However, even when Henry is speaking with his natural tone, his speech is that expected of a polite society in Britain at the time. < ref name= \" Irvine, Robert page 45 \" / >  The ingenue Catherine, who has just arrived in Bath, is unfamiliar with the ways of a polite society, and is vaguely aware that Henry's  \" affected \"  tone is meant to be satirical, but is

Thorpe is simply too vulgar to be a gentleman despite being of the gentry, which is further emphasised in that when he pays Catherine a compliment, she says it  \" gives me no pleasure \"  to receive a compliment from someone like him. < ref name= \" Irvine, Robert page 46 \" / >  Isabella Thorpe initially appears as Catherine's friend, but she proves herself an unworthy friend when she mentions

scholar Rachel Brownstein noted that Henry Tilney is described as  \" not quite handsome though very near it \" , it is implied to be not quite entirely manly owing to his love of literature and fabrics, and is explicitly shown to be dominated by his father. < ref name= \" ReferenceD \" > Brownstein, Rachel  \" Northanger Abbey, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice \"  pages 32-57 from

Brownstein wrote that Henry is the hero of the book as he constantly ridicules clich\u00e9 language, is able to understand the type of books read by women because he also reads them, and is able to

London: Allen and West, No. 15 Paternoster Row.) \n \n All seven of these were republished by the Folio Society in London in the 1960s, and since 2005 Valancourt Books has released new editions of the  \" horrids \" , the seventh and final being released in 2015. < ref >  < /ref > \n \n === The Mysteries of Udolpho === \n The most significant allusion, however, is to Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho, as it is the Gothic novel most frequently mentioned within this text. Notably, Jane Austen sold the manuscript of Northanger Abbey to the same firm that published Radcliffe's novel in 1794. < ref name= \" Northanger \"  / > \n \n This outside text is first mentioned in Chapter Six, when Isabella and Catherine discuss the mystery  \" behind the black veil \" , and further establish their friendship based on their similar interests in novel genre, and their plans to continue reading other Gothic novels together. Austen further satirizes the novel through Catherine's stay at Northanger Abbey, believing that General Tilney has taken the role of Gothic novel villain. < ref name= \" Gutenberg \"  / > \n \n Austen's discussion of Udolpho is also used to clearly separate Catherine from John Thorpe, as when Catherine talks about the novel with him, he crudely responds that he  \" never reads novels \" , but qualifies his statement by arguing he would only read a novel by Ann Radcliffe, who, as Catherine then points out, is the author of Udolpho. < ref name= \" Northanger \"  / >  Here, Austen humorously categorizes Northanger Abbey\u2019s characters into two spheres: those who read novels, and those who do not. When Catherine and Henry Tilney later discuss reading novels, and Henry earnestly responds that he enjoys reading novels, and was especially titillated by Udolpho, the match between Catherine and Henry is implied as both smart and fitting. < ref name= \" Northanger \"  / > \n \n == Allusions to Northanger Abbey== \n \n A passage from the novel appears as the preface of Ian McEwan's Atonement, thus likening the naive mistakes of Austen's Catherine Morland to those of his own character Briony Tallis, who is in a similar position: both characters have very over-active imaginations, which lead to misconceptions that cause distress in the lives of people around them. Both treat their own lives like those of heroines in fantastical works of fiction, with Miss Morland likening herself to a character in a Gothic novel and young Briony Tallis writing her own melodramatic stories and plays with central characters such as  \" spontaneous Arabella \"  based on herself. \n \n Richard Adams quotes a portion of the novel's last sentence for the epigraph to Chapter 50 in his Watership Down; the reference to the General is felicitous, as the villain in Watership Down is also a General. < ref >  < /ref > \n \n Jasper Fforde, in his alternate history comic fantasy novel First Among Sequels, refers to Northanger Abbey as being under maintenance, and  \" should be ready on time as long as Catherine stops attempting to have the book 'Gothicized'. \"  It appears again as the prize in a reality program, based on the lives of the Bennets from Pride and Prejudice. < ref >  < /ref > \n \n == Reference to baseball == \n The book, also, contains an early historical reference to baseball. < ref >  < /ref >  It is found in the first chapter of the novel, describing the interest of the heroine :  \" Catherine, who had by nature nothing heroic about her, should prefer cricket, baseball, riding on horseback, and running about the country \" . < ref >  < /ref >  It is not the earliest known reference to the term, which is a 1744 British publication, A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, by John Newbery, as described in Origins of baseball. The modern game is not described, but the term is used. \n \n ==Adaptations== \n \n ===Film, TV or theatrical adaptations=== \n *Spanish television TVE loosely adapted the story as La abad\u00eda de Northanger in 1968. It starred Lola Herrera as Catalina (Catherine) Morland, Alicia Hermida as Isabela Thorpe, and Pepe Mart\u00edn as Henry Tilney. < ref >  < /ref > < ref >  < /ref > \n *The A & E Network and the BBC released the television adaptation Northanger Abbey in 1987. \n *An adaptation of Northanger Abbey with screenplay by Andrew Davies, was shown on ITV on 25 March 2007 as part of their  \" Jane Austen Season \" . This adaptation aired on PBS in the United States as part of the  \" Complete Jane Austen \"  on Masterpiece Classic in January 2008. It stars Felicity Jones as Catherine Morland and JJ Feild as Henry Tilney. \n *A stage adaptation of Northanger Abbey by Tim Luscombe (published by Nick Hern Books ), was produced by Salisbury Playhouse in 2009. It was revived in Chicago in 2013 at the Remy Bumppo Theatre. < ref >  < /ref > \n *A theatrical adaptation by Michael Napier Brown was performed at the Royal Theatre in Northampton in 1998. \n *The 1993 independent film Ruby in Paradise starring Ashley Judd was loosely inspired by Northanger Abbey.  \n *  \" Pup Fiction \"  \u2013 an episode of Wishbone featuring the plot and characters of Austen's Northanger Abbey. \n \n ===Radio=== \n * In 2016, BBC Radio 4 broadcast an adaptation by Hattie Naylor with Georgia Groome as Catherine. An adaptation of The Mysteries of Udolpho was broadcast at the same time, also adapted by Naylor, with the same cast. \n \n === Audio drama === \n \n *In July 2017, Audible released an original dramatisation of Northanger Abbey featuring Emma Thompson, Douglas Booth, Eleanor Tomlinson, Ella Purnell, Jeremy Irvine and Lily Cole. \n \n === Web series === \n \n * In 2015, the modern web series adaptation Northbound, by Anya Steiner, was released on YouTube. \n * In 2016, the modern web series adaptation The Cate Morland Chronicles was released on YouTube. \n \n ===Literature=== \n HarperCollins hired Scottish crime writer Val McDermid in 2012 to adapt Northanger Abbey for a modern audience, as a suspenseful teen thriller, the second rewrite in The Austen Project. < ref >  < /ref > < ref >  < /ref >  McDermid said of the project,  \" At its heart it\u2019s a teen novel, and a satire \u2013 that\u2019s something which fits really well with contemporary fiction. And you can really feel a shiver of fear moving through it. I will be keeping the suspense \u2013 I know how to keep the reader on the edge of their seat. I think Jane Austen builds suspense well in a couple of places, but she squanders it, and she gets to the endgame too quickly. So I will be working on those things. \"  The novel was published in 2014. < ref name=Baker2016 >  < /ref > < ref >  < /ref > < ref >  < /ref > \n \n In 2011, Marvel published a graphic novel version of Northanger Abbey, adapted by Nancy Butler (writer), Janet K.

["Anticipations", "Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress upon Human Life and Thought, generally known as Anticipations, was written by H.G. Wells at the age of 34. He later called the book, which became a bestseller,  \" the keystone to the main arch of my work. \" < ref > Norman and Jeanne Mackenzie, H.G. Wells: A Biography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1973), p. 161. < /ref >  His most recent biographer, however, calls the volume  \" both the starting point and the lowest point in Wells's career as a social thinker. \" < ref > Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), pp. 151-52). < /ref > \n \n Taking the revolution in transport facilitated by the  \" mechanical revolution \"  as his point of departure, Wells told readers they were living through a reorganization of human society that would alter every dimension of life.  An academic biographer has described the degree of accuracy of Wells's predictions as  \" certainly phenomenal. \" < ref > David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 92. < /ref > \n \n The chapters of Anticipations appeared in Great Britain in the Fortnightly Review (April\u2013December 1901) and in the United States in the North American Review (June\u2013November 1901), and were published as a book in November 1901.  Anticipations was  \" Wells's first non-fiction bestseller. \" < ref > David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 91. < /ref >  The volume was reissued by Chapman and Hall in 1914, on the eve of World War I. \n \n ==Synopsis== \n \n ===Chapter 1: Locomotion in the Twentieth Century=== \n Proposing to forecast  \" the way things will probably go in this new century, \"  Wells's point of departure is  \" the probable developments and changes of the means of land locomotion during the coming decades. \"   Taking the  \" steam engine running on a railway \"  to be the most characteristic symbol of the 19th century, he analyzes the historical factors that led it to appear when it did.  Wells predicts that  \" new motor vehicles \"  will lead to trucks, cars ( \" motor carriages \" ), and buses ( \" the motor omnibus \" ) that will be  \" segregated \"  from horse traffic on  \" special roads \"  competing with railways. < ref > H.G. Wells, Anticipations, Ch. 1. < /ref > \n \n ===Chapter 2:  The Probable Diffusion of Great Cities=== \n Wells argues that the speed of land travel stands  \" in almost fundamental relation to human society. \"   The speeding up of land locomotion will therefore revolutionize human society.  Rather than producing even larger cities, a new sort of  \" human distribution \"  will be created, with the increase in the distance a worker can travel in an hour acting as a  \" centrifugal \"  force leading to a considerable development of  \" suburbs \"  while this development is counterbalanced by  \" centripetal considerations \"  like a desire for access to shopping districts, good schools, doctors, and  \" the love of the crowd. \"   The terms  \" town \"  and  \" country \"  will become obsolete as a new kind of  \" urban region \"  develops. < ref > H.G. Wells, Anticipations, Ch. 2. < /ref > \n \n ===Chapter 3: Developing Social Elements=== \n The two-class social system of a lower class administered by a superior class derived from the speed of horses in an agricultural society, according to Wells. The revolution in technology, he predicts, will produce in the 20th century a system of four classes:  (1)  \" the shareholding class \"  administering  \" irresponsible property \" ; (2)  \" the abyss, \"  consisting of people  \" without either property or any evident function in the social organism \" ; (3) a reconstructed, productive, and  \" capable \"  middle class, including, notably,  \" mechanics and engineers, \"  whose potential will depend on the education this class receives, no longer being  \" middle \"  in any meaningful sense; and (4) a class of non-productive business managers, political organizers, brokers, financiers, clerks, etc.   \" All these elements will be mingled confusedly together, passing into one another by insensible gradations. \"   Wells regards the United States as  \" the social mass which has perhaps advanced furthest along the new lines. \" < ref > H.G. Wells, Anticipations, Ch. 3. < /ref > \n \n ===Chapter 4: Certain Social Reactions=== \n Circa 2000, Wells predicts, the capable productive class will have developed a way of life characterized by a scientific worldview, an ethos of social duty, and an unsentimental view of personal relations that lead it to view  \" a childless, sterile life \"  as  \" essentially failure and perversion. \"   Families of this class will live in efficient households with no need for domestic servants.  The shareholder class will cultivate opulent, archaic decoration, which Wells clearly deplores, and he also fears that its wealth may enable it not only to  \" buy up almost all the available architectural talent \"  but also  \" in a certain figurative sense\u2014buy up much of the womankind \"  that would otherwise belong to the capable class. < ref > H.G. Wells, Anticipations, Ch. 4. < /ref > \n \n ===Chapter 5: The Life-History of Democracy=== \n Wells argues that  \" democracy \"  is a term with little specificity, signifying little more than a denial  \" that any specific person or persons should act as a matter of intrinsic right or capacity on behalf of the community as a whole. \"   As a political creed, Wells considers democracy flimsy and untenable:   \" I know of no case for the elective Democratic government of modern states that cannot be knocked to pieces in five minutes. \"   The appearance of representative democracy Wells links to what he called the  \" mechanical revolution \"  (hence its early appearance in Great Britain, the U.S., and France), and explains the appearance of a belief in  \" the people \"  as little more than a disbelief in monarchs and nobles.  In Wells's view, it is not the people but rather  \" a scientifically trained middle-class of an unprecedented sort \"  that  \" will become, I believe, at last consciously the State. \"   The real governors that  \" democracy \"  produces\u2014political bosses and demagogues\u2014Wells regards as likely to provoke wars. But they will be incapable of managing these wars, leading to their replacement. < ref > H.G. Wells, Anticipations, Ch. 5 (emphasis in original). < /ref > \n \n ===Chapter 6:  War=== \n Wells sees the mechanical revolution as making the division of armies into infantry and cavalry obsolete.  The  \" new war \"  is determined by the increasing range and accuracy of the rifle (and also of the field gun).  Wells predicts that a few snipers will be able to defend territory against a larger force.  War will become less  \" dramatic \"  and more  \" monstrous. \"   The State will organize all of society for the support of its war machine.  Wells analyzes how tactics will be altered by rapid locomotion, command of the air, and  \" light, swift ships. \"   (But  \" my imagination, in spite even of spurring, refuses to see any sort of submarine doing anything but suffocate its crew and founder at sea. \" ) Technical, not moral factors will be determinate.  Societies with the most well developed and consolidated  \" educated efficient classes \"  will prevail. < ref > H.G. Wells, Anticipations, Ch. 6. < /ref > \n \n ===Chapter 7: The Conflict of Language=== \n Wells predicts that  \" unifying sources \"  give only English, French (or possibly German), and Chinese a chance of flourishing in the future.  Dismissing the racialist thought associated with romantic nationalism as  \" nonsense, \"  he predicts that languages like Spanish and Russian by the year 2000 will  \" be tending more and more to be the second tongues of bilingual communities. \" < ref > H.G. Wells, Anticipations, Ch. 7. < /ref > \n \n ===Chapter 8: The Larger Synthesis=== \n Though it may take  \" centuries of misunderstanding and bloodshed, \"  Wells predicts that the process he is describing  \" aims finally, and will attain to the establishment of one world-state at peace within itself. \"   Present-day economic integration anticipates this, as do  \" at least five spacious movements of coalescence \" :  Anglo-Saxonism, British imperialism, Pan-Germanism, Pan-Slavism, and the idea of a union of  \" Latin \"  peoples.  Wells analyzes each of these.  But he believes it is  \" a naturally and informally organized, educated class \"  rather than any regional political movement that will be the means whereby  \" a New Republic \"  will come to dominate the world.  Wells scrutinizes the present for signs of such a development, and finds them in American trusts, unofficial organizations like the Navy League, philanthropic tycoons, etc. < ref > H.G. Wells, Anticipations, Ch. 8. < /ref > \n \n ===Chapter 9: The Faith, Morals, and Public Policy of the New Republic=== \n In his concluding chapter, Wells went as far as he ever did in the direction of eugenics, advocating a  \" euthanasia of the weak and the sensual. \"   In his text, he insists that social groups will not be treated  \" as races at all \"  but as individuals.  It cannot be denied, however, that Wells declares that he rejects racism and anti-Semitism.  A recent biographer has said that  \" Nothing has done more damage to Wells's reputation than the concluding chapter of Anticipations. \" < ref > Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), pp. 148-49. < /ref > \n \n Wells predicts that a stern morality freed from the trammels of exploded religious beliefs and based on ideas of Malthusianism and natural selection will sustain aggressive action of the  \" World State \"  to  \" check \"  and  \" control \"  human activity so as  \" to favour the procreation of what is fine and efficient and beautiful in humanity. \"   The future rulers will not quail before the need to use the  \" method \"  of  \" death \" ; about death  \" they will have no superstitions. \"    \" [G]ood scientifically caused pain \"  may also be used, but its use can be  \" unsafe and demoralizing \"  for those who inflict it.  So  \" [t]o kill under the seemly conditions science will afford is a far less offensive thing. \"   Sexual morality, on the other hand, will be comprehensively liberalized, facilitating the goal of having  \" perhaps half the population of the world, in every generation, restrained from or tempted to evade reproduction. \"   Declaring these to be policies devoted to  \" a purpose greater than happiness, \"  Wells declares that it is not for immortality, but for the  \" spacious \"   \" future of our race \"  [i.e. the human race], that the  \" kinetic men of the coming time \"  will  \" live and die. \" < ref > H.G. Wells, Anticipations, Ch. 9. < /ref > \n \n ==Genesis== \n The idea of writing the articles that became the chapters of Anticipations was suggested to Wells by James B. Pinker, his literary agent.  Pinker persuaded Wells that  \" the thinking literary men \"  had a responsibility to express their views. < ref > David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 91. < /ref >  It is perhaps also noteworthy that the book was written while Wells awaited the birth of his first child, George Philip ( \" Gip \" ) Wells, born on July 17, 1901. < ref > Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), p. 146. < /ref > \n \n In a letter to Elizabeth Healy, Wells said that the purpose of Anticipations was  \" to undermine and destroy the monarch, monogamy, faith in God  &  respectability\u2014 &  the British Empire, all under the guise of a speculation about motor cars  &  electric heating. \" < ref > Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), p. 147. < /ref > \n \n ==Reception== \n In the words of a biographer, Anticipations  \" took England by storm, \"  making Wells  \" almost famous in fact. \" < ref > David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 92. < /ref >  Vigorously promoted, the book and its views were widely discussed.   \" Every significant thinker [in Great Britain] apparently read and thought about the book, \"  according to an academic biographer. < ref > David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 95. < /ref > \n \n The publication of Anticipations led to Wells's friendship with E. Ray Lancaster, the director of the Museum of Natural History.  The book was appreciated by Sidney and Beatrice Webb, who introduced Wells to Graham Wallas.  William James predicted that Anticipations would influence British youth, but thought that Wells did not allow sufficiently for  \" human nature. \" < ref > David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), pp. 94-95. < /ref > \n \n Wells's Anticipations, together with his next production, The Discovery of the Future, established him as  \" a great man, \"  according to one biographer, and as a result he was soon sought out by many leading figures of the day.   \" Bertie Wells had been transformed into H.G. \" < ref > David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 97. < /ref >  He became a major literary figure as well as new socialist leader who was courted by the Fabians. \n \n Later readers have recoiled at what Lovat Dickson in 1969 called the book's suggestion of  \" strong-armed fascism. \" < ref > Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), p. 150. < /ref >  W. Warren Wagar, discussing Anticipations''' advocacy of racism, eugenics and capital punishment, noted  \" To Wells' credit, he would soon abandon such thoughts, but they were all here in plain English in Anticipations and we have no power or licence to wish them away \" . < ref > W. Warren Wagar, H.G. Wells: Traversing Time. Middletown, Connecticut Wesleyan University Press, 2004.  (pp. 90-1). < /ref >  A number of writers (e.g. Michael Coren < ref > Michael Coren, The Invisible Man : The Life and Liberties of H.G.

Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), pp. 150, 455. < /ref >  But in fact Wells responded to criticism and was soon arguing against the negative eugenics advocated in Chapter 9, and he later became a leading advocate of human rights. Sherborne notes within two years of the publication of Anticipations:  \" Wells would be arguing against negative eugenics; within three defending black people against race prejudice; within four advocating the desirability of a multitracial society \" . < ref > Michael Sherborne, H.G.

["City of Light, City of Dark", "City Of Light, City Of Dark is a comic book novel written by Newbery Medal-winning author Avi, and was the first book ever to be illustrated by Brian Floca. < ref name= \" Brian_Floca_first \" >  < /ref >  Additional Spanish translations were done by Jose Aranda and Anthony Trujillo. The book's title is probably inspired by the summer and winter solstices, the  \" lightest \"  and  \" darkest \"  days of the year. These two days also mark two pivotal events in the Kurbs'  \" ritual cycle of acknowledgment \" . Alternatively, since the story is set in New York,  \" City Of Light \"  could refer to one of the many cities of light. \n \n ==Plot synopsis== \n \n An enigmatic race of beings known as the Kurbs are introduced at the story's outset. Except as serpentine extensions of shadow, they are rarely seen, and thrive only in darkness. Utilizing something called the Power, they are able to control the rhythm of day and night. When humans first arrived on Manhattan Island (a place of apparent significance to the Kurbs), a treaty was signed: the Ritual Cycle of Acknowledgment. The Kurbs would loan the island out for human use, and even share their source of power. But there were conditions: in synchronization with the summer and winter solstices, the source of Power would be ritualistically hidden somewhere on the island, and if it was not found in time, the Kurbs would reclaim the island, and everything would freeze. Over the years, the Power was hidden inside different objects, including an ear of corn, a musket ball, an oil lamp and, most recently, a subway token. A lineage of women were given the responsibility of carrying out the Ritual Cycle Of Acknowledgment, and were granted special powers through the Kurbs' source of Power, as well. \n \n This system works for centuries until evil Mr. Underton tried to steal the Power a few years back, and lost his eyesight. Now he is close to stealing it once again, and if he succeeds, the Kurbs will take back the City, reducing it to a dark and frozen tundra. It's up to two kids named Carlos and Sarah to find the subway token with the Power and keep the City safe, despite secrets of Sarah's history that are entwined with the token. What ensues is a race against darkness. A race against the lies of the past. And most of all, a race against time. \n \n ==Style== \n \n City Of Light, City Of Dark is both a comic book and a novel. It begins like an illustrated storybook: paragraphs of text are accompanied by frequent illustrations, establishing the backstory more quickly than would have been possible with sequential art alone. Comic book panels tell the rest of the story, occasionally helped along by the author's narrations, which are presented in the form of captions. This method of storytelling makes City Of Light, City Of Dark unique. Brian Floca's Franco-Belgian-inspired art style and frequent cross-hatching also give this modern fantasy an appropriately contemporary feel. \n \n ==References== \n  \n \n Category:1993 graphic novels \n Category:Novels by Avi", ["Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels", "Wikipedia:WikiProject Books", "Brian Floca", "Avi (author)", "Brian Floca", "English language", "Spanish language", "Fantasy", "Parallel universe (fiction)", "Scholastic Corporation", "Hardcover", "Paperback", "comic book", "novel", "Newbery Medal", "Edward Irving Wortis", "Brian Floca", "solstice", "New York City", "Manhattan Island", "solstice", "maize", "Musket#Ammunition", "oil lamp", "subway token", "comic book", "novel", "Children's Literature", "illustrations", "backstory", "Panel (comics)", "narrative", "caption (comics convention)", "Franco-Belgian comics", "cross-hatching", "Category:1993 graphic novels", "Category:Novels by Avi"]]
["The Space Between Us (novel)", "The Space Between Us is the second novel by Thrity Umrigar, published by William Morrow and Company in January 2006.  Set in present-day Mumbai, India, the novel follows the lives of two women: Serabai Dubash, an upper-middle-class widow, and her domestic servant, Bhima. The pair experience similar situations in their lives: abuse, the death or absence of a husband, a pregnant dependent, and the hope for a better future. Told using an omniscient third-person narrative in mainly present tense, the novel incorporates Hindi words and phrases amongst predominantly English text. \n \n Influenced by Umrigar's real-life experience with the employer-servant relationship, the novel explores social class in India and the division of power in society.  Umrigar, who was born and lived in Mumbai until the age of twenty-one,  modeled Bhima after a domestic servant of the same name who worked in her childhood home and for whom Umrigar had much admiration.  Upon its release, The Space Between Us received largely positive reviews from English-language critics.  While the majority of reviewers enjoyed Umrigar's simple, descriptive prose, a few questioned whether she depended  on clich\u00e9s and exaggeration. Critics praised her lively depiction of Mumbai and the sympathetic characters, and noted the social commentary present in the novel. \n \n ==Plot== \n The Space Between Us takes place in present-day India and centers on two women: Serabai (Sera) Dubash, an upper-middle-class, Parsi widow, and her domestic servant of more than twenty years, Bhima. Now sixty-five years old, illiterate Bhima lives in the slums of Mumbai with her pregnant, unwed granddaughter, the seventeen-year-old Maya, whose college tuition is paid for by Sera. Through flashbacks, Bhima remembers her husband, who, after a work-related accident caused him to lose three fingers, became an alcoholic and abandoned her, taking their son Amit with him. She also remembers her daughter Pooja, who married, but died of AIDS together with her husband, leaving Maya an orphan at a young age. \n \n Since the sudden death of her physically abusive husband three years ago, Sera has cared for her disabled mother-in-law, who had insisted on isolating her from the family when Sera was menstruating. Sera also tends to her pregnant daughter Dinaz, and pays for  Maya's abortion. A while later,  Maya reluctantly tells Bhima that Dinaz's husband Viraf impregnated her and told her to keep it a secret so that she could continue her education and Bhima could keep her job. Angered, Bhima confronts Viraf, and he later accuses her of stealing  from the cupboard. Sera dismisses her, unable to listen to Bhima's hints about Viraf's actions towards Maya. Bhima leaves, and recalling a balloon seller whom she had admired, buys  worth of balloons and goes to the seaside. She resolves to deal with tomorrow. \n \n ==Style and themes== \n thumb|Fond of visiting the sea as a child, Umrigar presents it in The Space Between Us as a way for the people to replenish their spirit and connect with nature. < ref >  < /ref >  \n \n Using an omniscient third-person narrative, The Space Between Us divides itself between the stories of its two protagonists, Sera and Bhima. < ref name= \" The Independent \" / >  Although the novel occasionally explores their memories in flashbacks, Thrity Umrigar wrote much of the novel in the present tense and used adjectives, similes, and metaphors frequently in her descriptions. < ref name= \" The Independent \" / > < ref name= \" San Francisco Chronicle \" / >  She also incorporated Hindi words alongside English ones in the novel:  \" What is this, baba?

["The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp", "The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp  is an autobiography published in 1908 by the Welsh poet and writer W. H. Davies (1871\u20131940). A large part of the book's subject matter describes the way of life of the tramp in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States in the final decade of the 19th century. \n \n ==Publication history== \n George Bernard Shaw had become interested in Davies, a literary unknown at the time, and had agreed to write a preface for the book, largely through the efforts of his wife Charlotte. It was only because of Shaw that Davies' contract with the publishers was re-written to allow the author to retain the serial rights, all rights after three years, royalties of fifteen per cent of selling price and a non-returnable advance of \u00a325 (equivalent to \u00a3). Davies was also to be given a say on the style of all illustrations, advertisement layouts and cover designs. The original publisher, Duckworth and Sons, refused to accept these demands and so the book was placed instead with Fifield. Shaw was also instrumental in keeping the unusual title of the book, of which Davies himself was unsure, and which later proved to be controversial with some reviewers. < ref name= \" Stone \" >  < /ref > \n \n The book was the third published by Davies, having been preceded by The Soul's Destroyer (1905) and New Poems (1907). The 1920 edition of the book concludes with five poems selected by Davies from The Soul's Destroyer. \n \n The book was written in the space of six weeks,  \" a great achievement for a first book by a man with the minimum of education. \" < ref name=waters > Waters, B.

At the age of twenty-two, having borrowed money from the executor of his grandmother\u2019s estate, he sailed to America. This was the first of more than a dozen Atlantic crossings, often made by working his passage aboard a cattle boat. Between 1893 and 1899 Davies travelled the highways and railroads, tutored by hardened men of the road. He took advantage of the corrupt system of  \" boodle jails \"  in order to pass the winter in Michigan, staying in a series of different jails. These were jails in which a tramp could make an illicit arrangement with a law enforcement officer to stay in the jail without being an actual prisoner. < ref > Partridge, E. (1968), A Dictionary of the Underworld: British and American, George Allen  &  Unwin, p.62 < /ref >  Here, with his fellow tramps, Davies would enjoy the relative comfort of  \" card-playing, singing, smoking, reading, relating experiences and occasionally taking exercise or going out for a walk. \" < ref > Hockey, L. (1971), W. H. Davies, University of Wales Press (on behalf of the Welsh Arts Council), p.16 < /ref >  Regular work was never an option and Davies subsisted largely by begging. After crossing the Atlantic from Britain to Canada at the time of the Klondike Gold Rush, Davies fell while hopping a train. His foot was crushed and his leg had to be amputated below the knee. He later wrote of the effect the accident had on his life:  \" All the wildness had been taken out of me and my adventures after this were not of my own seeking. \" \n \n The book was praised by Osbert Sitwell for its  \" primitive splendour and directness \" , while Bernard Shaw himself commended the prose to  \" literary experts for its style alone \" , describing Davies as  \" the incorrigible Supertramp who wrote this amazing book. \" \n \n ==Adaptations== \n * In 1948 the BBC Home Service (now BBC Radio 4) recorded a potted version of the book over fifteen consecutive Sundays, beginning on 4 April. < ref >  < /ref > < ref name= \" Ferris \" >  < /ref >  It was narrated by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas. < ref name= \" Ferris \" / > \n \n ==In popular culture== \n On the official website of the British progressive rock band Supertramp, reviewer P.

["Gentlemen  &  Players", "Gentlemen  &  Players is a novel by Joanne Harris first published in 2005. A dark psychological thriller, some of the themes may be partly based on Harris' experiences as a teacher at Leeds Grammar School. Set in the present day during Michaelmas term at St Oswald's, a grammar school for boys somewhere in the North of England, the book is a psychological thriller about class distinctions, damaged childhood, secrets, identity and revenge. \n \n ==Plot introduction== \n St Oswald's is a long-established boys' grammar school in the North of England. A new academic year has just begun and change is afoot. Roy Straitley, the Classics master and a veteran of St Oswald's, is contemplating retirement. Increased paperwork, computers, Health  &  Safety and a new generation of administrators have finally persuaded him that he no longer has a place in the world of education. However, St Oswald's is about to suffer a cataclysmic upheaval. \n \n It begins with a series of small acts of mischief conducted by someone on school premises. At first, no one thinks of connecting these seemingly isolated incidents. But gradually, as the incidents become increasingly serious, it becomes clear that someone with inside knowledge is intent on causing real damage. Only Mr Straitley may have the key to the identity of the mysterious saboteur - but can he expose the enemy in time to prevent a murder? \n \n ==Plot summary== \n \n As the new school year starts in September, Roy Straitley is looking forward to his 100th term at St Oswald's, where he has been teaching for 33 years. Having never married, he lives alone and has devoted his life to his career. His sitting room walls are full of pictures of  \" his boys \" , and St Oswald's represents his only family. He is slightly overweight and ugly by conventional standards (his nickname among his pupils is  \" Quaz \" , short for  \" Quasimodo \" ). Popular with the students, he adheres to the old principle of being  \" firm but fair \"  where teaching and disciplinary matters are concerned. An incurable optimist, Straitley is only uncomfortable when he has to deal with the opposite sex. He is a keen observer, and hardly anything connected with life at the school, however insignificant, ever escapes his notice. A firm believer in the advantages and importance of a classical education, he shuns computers, resorts to Latin to swear and insult his colleagues (which they do not understand), and opposes the idea of any competition between schools other than the kind which is carried out on the playing fields. Smoking Gauloises in his empty form room is his  \" one concession to the influence of the Modern Languages \" , and there is long-standing enmity between Straitley and Dr Devine, the Head of German. \n \n The other masters are mostly set in their ways, St Oswald's having made an indelible imprint on their lives. There is Pat Bishop, the Second Master, who has also remained unmarried and who occasionally, at busy times, spends the night in his office doing administrative work. Always intent on mediating between rivalling factions, Bishop has been able to keep his affair with his secretary a secret so as not to blemish the school's reputation. There is Bob Strange, the Third Master, a bureaucrat unpopular with the pupils who has been trying for years to get rid of Straitley and force him into early retirement ( \" Young blood is cheaper. \" ). There are the members of the German department ( \" Teutons \" , according to the old Latin master), among them Geoff and Penny ( \" League of \" ) Nations, a married couple described by Straitley as hypocrites and sycophants. There is Tony Beard, head of computer science and eo ipso Straitley's natural adversary. And there is Isabelle Tapi, a part-time French teacher who is said to have made passes at each new male addition to the staff. \n \n At the beginning of the new term, it is the  \" freshers \"  on whom Straitley focuses his observations. There are five of them, among them Jeff Light, a Games master who has become a teacher because he thinks it is an easy job; Chris Keane, who teaches English but actually wants to be a novelist; and Dianne Dare, an attractive young woman who teaches French. \n \n The new term starts with a number of minor yet inexplicable occurrences. For the first time in his life, Straitley's register goes missing without ever turning up again. Also, his coffee mug is no longer at the place in the Common Room where it has sat for many years. Pupils report that various objects are missing from their classrooms or lockers. In particular, a 13-year-old Jewish boy from Straitley's form deplores the alleged theft of his expensive fountain pen, a Bar Mitzvah present. Presently, the boy's mother accuses the school and especially Straitley of anti-Semitism. Soon afterwards, a pupil in Straitley's class nearly dies, following another malicious trick, and closely guarded secrets in the lives of the St Oswald's staff are anonymously revealed. Life at St Oswald's begins to suffer a gradual disintegration. One morning, after the discovery of a computer virus on the school's computer system, Pat Bishop is arrested, because child pornography has been downloaded onto his computer and paid for with his credit card. Bishop denies this, but the damage to his career has been done. Meanwhile, a mysterious figure called  \" Mole \"  publishes in the local newspaper damaging allegations about St Oswald's. \n \n Straitley begins to suspect that, not only are all these incidents orchestrated by the same malicious individual, but that this person is deliberately trying to bring down St. Oswald's. \n \n The novel is written using Harris' typical split-narrative technique. The first narrator (indicated at the beginning of each chapter by a white King) is Straitley himself, and focuses on the day-to-day events at St Oswald's as the situation develops. The second is marked by a Black Pawn, and is the voice of the mysterious enemy within St Oswald's, whose identity is only revealed  at the end of the book, and who, little by little, reveals the bitterness and hatred that drives a person to fake an identity, break the law and even to commit murder - all in the name of revenge. \n \n ==Characters in Gentlemen  &  Players== \n *Roy Straitley  & ndash; unmarried Classics master, called  \" Quaz \"  by his pupils. Highly intelligent, defiantly old-fashioned, very observant, devoted to his pupils and the School, he is totally unambitious, dislikes being told what to do, despises all innovations in teaching and has the habit of swearing in Latin at people who don't know the language. \n *Pat Bishop  & ndash; the Second Master, also unmarried, a keen sportsman devoted to St Oswald's. \n *Bob Strange  & ndash; the Third Master, a bureaucrat unpopular with the pupils; ambitious, narrow-minded and unscrupulous. \n *Geoff and Penny Nation  & ndash; a married couple, part of the German department. \n *Gerry Grachvogel \u2013 a \u201cwell-meaning ass with a predilection for flashcards.\u201d \n *Dr \u2018Sourgrape\u2019 Devine \u2013 Head of Department, with no interest in Classics. \n *Tony Beard  & ndash; head of computer science. \n *Isabelle Tapi  & ndash; a part-time French teacher,  \" rather useless in a leggy, Gallic kind of way \" \n *Jeff Light  & ndash; a Games master. Boorish and lazy. \n *Chris Keane  & ndash; a young man who teaches English but wants to be a novelist. \n *Dianne Dare  & ndash; an attractive young woman who teaches French. \n *The New Head: headmaster of St Oswald's. A born administrator, still referred to as the  \" New Head \"  by Straitley, even though he has been at St Oswald's for fifteen years. \n \n ==Major themes== \n Apart from the thrilling plot, Gentlemen and Players offers rich food for thought. Firstly, there is ample discussion of the teaching profession & mdash;its pros and cons, its beauty and its dangers. For example, in the novel a male teacher is accused by a malicious pupil, who only wants to divert attention from the student's own truancy, of having an affair with a 15-year-old girl. The ploy works, the unpleasant teacher is suspended and never seen again ( \" Mud sticks. \" ). On a different note, in recent years the paradox has cropped up of having to view pupils as  \" paying customers \"  whose wishes have to be respected at all times and at the same time as individuals in their formative years who must not only be encouraged and praised but also punished for their misbehaviour. \n \n Secondly, the novel gives an insight into the power structure which dominates a large institution of learning, where an individual teacher can never be sure whether a perceived attack on his own well-being has happened out of malice or sheer stupidity, or a combination of both. Siding with the winners or those in power to prevent such nuisances from happening or to advance one's own career is only one of the many human weaknesses which are on display in a professional environment where teamwork is actually supposed to be a prerequisite. \n \n Finally, Gentlemen and Players highlights class differences and class consciousness in Britain at the turn of the millennium. Compared to the pupils at the local comprehensive, the boys attending St Oswald's are a privileged group. In their world, if there is peer pressure, it is to fit in, learn and succeed rather than to misbehave, ridicule ambition and eventually drop out. \n  \n \n ==More about== \n \n \" Gentlemen and Players \"  is a reference to class differences and snobbery. In cricket, the Gentlemen v Players game was a first-class cricket match regularly played from 1806 until 1962 between a team made up of elite amateurs (the  \" Gentlemen \" ), young sportsmen of independent means (from the Universities), and one made up of professionals (the  \" Players \" ). Until the Sixties, Gentlemen and Players had separate changing rooms and entered the grounds through separate gates (You can still see these gates at Lord's) \n \n In Harris's novel, the enemy within St Oswald's and his opponent, Roy Straitley, are represented by chess pieces, a black pawn and a white king, as the deadly game unfolds. \n \n Although St. Oswald's, the staff, and the pupils are imaginary, Harris was a teacher at Leeds Grammar School. Therefore there are similarities between them, especially the staff. \n \n \" Gentlemen and Players \"  is also the title of a short story by E. W. Hornung, starring Raffles,  \" the gentleman thief \" . \n \n ==Literary significance  &  criticism== \n \n ===Narrative technique=== \n The story is told by two alternating first person narrators. One of them is Roy Hubert Straitley, a 65-year-old Classics master who has devoted all his life to St Oswald's and who now, nearing the end of his professional career, finds himself the last surviving member of the dying breed of classics teachers. The other narrator is the perpetrator, whose identity is only revealed in the final part of the book, and whose plotting the reader is able to follow first hand. Time and again, flashbacks detail the second narrator's childhood, adolescence and young adulthood, thus giving a fully rounded picture of a deranged mind and explaining why someone should want to demolish a school's reputation and do harm to members of the staff. \n \n ==Release details== \n *2005, UK, Doubleday (), Pub date 1 October 2005, hardback (First edition) \n *2005, UK, Corgi Audio (), Pub date 2 October 2005, audio book cassette (narrated by Derek Jacobi) \n *2005, UK, Corgi Audio (), Pub date 2 October 2005, audio book CD (narrated by Derek Jacobi) \n *2006, UK, Black Swan (), Pub date 5 June 2006, paperback \n *2006, USA, William Morrow (), Pub date ?

["Moment in Peking", "Moment in Peking is a novel originally written in English by Chinese author Lin Yutang.  The novel, Lin's first, covers the turbulent events in China from 1900 to 1938, including the Boxer Uprising, the Republican Revolution of 1911, the Warlord Era, the rise of nationalism and communism, and the start of the Sino-Japanese War of 1937-1945. \n \n ==Background== \n At the repeated invitation of Pearl S. Buck, who had sponsored the publication of Lin's bestselling My Country and My People in 1935, Lin left China for New York in August, 1936 to write The Importance of Living, which was published in August 1937 to even greater success just as war broke out in China. In 1938, Lin left New York to spend a year in Paris, where he wrote Moment in Peking. < ref > Suoqiao Qian, Liberal Cosmopolitan: Lin Yutang and Middling Chinese Modernity (Leiden: Brill, 2011). . p. 246-247 < /ref > \n \n Lin wrote the book in English for a U.S. audience, yet he based it in Chinese literature and philosophy. As an exercise, before he started to compose Moment in Peking, Lin translated passages from the classic Chinese novel  Dream of the Red Chamber, and followed its example in showing a spectrum of characters in their social settings and defining them through their clothing, jewelry, and footwear, and even by their language (dialect), geography (region), and foodways. < ref > George Gao,  \" Lin Yutang's Appreciation of the Red Chamber Dream, \"  Renditions 2.Spring (1974). < /ref >  Lin's eldest daughter Lin Rusi also indicates in an introductory essay to a Chinese translation of Moment in Peking that the entire book was influenced by Zhuang Zi and its message was  \" Life is but a dream. \" < ref > Airen Huang,  \" Hu Shi and Lin Yutang, \"  Chinese Studies in History 37.4 (Summer2004): 37-69. < /ref > \n \n Lin tries not to be overly judgemental of the characters because he recognizes that too many issues were involved in the chaotic years of early twentieth century China. There are no absolutely right or wrong characters. Each character held a piece of truth and reality and a piece of irrationality. In the preface, Lin writes that  \" [This novel] is merely a story of... how certain habits of living and ways of thinking are formed and how, above all, [men and women] adjust themselves to the circumstances in this earthly life where men strive but gods rule. \" \n \n While Lin does not display hatred toward the Japanese, he does let events and situations affect the novel's characters to let the reader clearly see the reason the Chinese are still bitter about Japan's military past.  The novel ends with a cliffhanger, letting readers hope that the major characters who fled from the coastal regions to the inland of China would survive the horrible war. In the final pages of the book Lin observes:  \" What an epic story was being lived through by these people of China.... And it seemed to them that their own story was but a moment in old, ageless Peking, a story written by the finger of Time itself.... In this moving mass of refugees, there was now neither rich nor poor. \" < ref > Moment in Peking, pp. 813-15. < /ref > \n \n The sequel, A Leaf in the Storm, published in 1941, does not follow the same characters, but takes up in 1937, at roughly the point in time when Moment in Peking leaves off. \n \n ==Main characters== \n Many characters are from three wealthy families: Yao, Tseng (Zeng), and New (Niu), but characters from other families play an integral part in the story, such as Lifu, from the Kong family. \n \n * Yao Mulan (\u59da\u6728\u862d) \n The protagonist of the story, Mulan, is from the wealthy Yao family. During the Boxer Uprising many people left Peking and fled to other regions to avoid the turmoil and chaos of war. On the way to Hangchow she is separated from her family and then seized and sold to a human trafficking group, Fortunately the Tseng family  track her down and buy (rescue) her. The two families become close friends and possible future in-laws. Mulan is lively, beautiful, intelligent and generous, as well as responsible. Her father has always encouraged her interests, among them her interest in  \" oracle bones, \"  which reveal ancient Chinese characters, and the singing of Chinese opera. Kung Lifu and his mother, Mrs.Kung are family friends of the Yaos. Both Mulan and Mochow have found Lifu to be deep, erudite, and virtuous: a promising future scholar and an interesting figure. Mulan is attracted to Lifu, but marriage and a romantic relationship had not crossed his mind. On the other hand, her reunion with her family seems so mysterious a circumstance, that on some level    she feels that marriage with Sunya is fated. So with blessings from both families, she marries Sunya.  Their marriage is mostly peaceful and harmonious. Together they have three children: Aman, Atung and Amei. \n \n * Tseng Sunya (Zeng Sunya, \u66fe\u84c0\u4e9e) \n Mulan's husband, Tseng Sunya, is affectionately called  \" Fatty \"  by Mulan. As the youngest son of his family, Sunya is arguably the least responsible one, but has what is called a  \" round character \" . He and Mulan had gotten to know each other well when they were children after Mulan was rescued from bandits by his parents.

She married Lifu, when he was a poor scholar, and unlike many marriages in the olden times, she had an eye for Lifu long before their engagement.  Mochow is stable, reliable and extremely responsible. She takes care of her sick mother for years, remaining by her side. She knows her sister's love for Lifu, but she is confident in their sisterly love. \n \n * Yao Sze-an (Yao Si'an) (\u59da\u601d\u5b89) \n He was a playboy when he was young. However, he has become a great Taoist monk later. He influenced Lifu very much. Sze-an was also interested in  \" oracle bones \" \n \n * Mrs. Yao (\u59da\u592a\u592a) \n A traditional Chinese woman.

Though her family name is Xie, not Yao, she has always considered the Yaos as her real family. Her father, Mr.Xie, is a close friend of Yao Si-an's.

She is second in command when it came to daily routines in the house and has been a great help to Mrs. Yao. She was 19 years old when she married a fine young man, who died a year later and left her childless and alone. So she returned home. \n * Cassia (Auntie Gui, \u6842\u59e8) \n The concubine or maid in the Tseng household.

She holds the family together, and she likes Mulan and Mannia, but Suyun's behavior annoys her. \n \n * New Suyun (Niu Suyun, \u725b\u7d20\u96f2) \n Her parents thought Chinya was a man who had the right character to be a successful officer, so Suyun marries him. During their marriage, she bosses and orders him around like a busboy. Suyun later becomes a friend of Inging, her second brother's concubine. She divorces Chinya, and becomes an officer's concubine and also the infamous Japanese-controlled heroin dealer known as the  \" White Powder Queen. \"  When she finally recognizes her mistake she is killed by the Japanese army. \n \n * Sun Mannia (\u5b6b\u66fc\u5a18) \n Married to the Tseng's eldest son, Pingya.

When she misunderstands a conversation and thinks that Afei doesn't love her, she drowns herself, or so it seems. She dies in vain, leaving her parents devastated. Her death provides a reflection on the Yaos: ill-mannered, irresponsible, negligent. The so-called blood-ties are so weak when it comes to real commitment. \n \n == Reception and influence == \n \n Time magazine wrote that Moment in Peking is  \" modeled exactly on traditional Chinese novels, \"  which are among the world's longest, oldest, and most thickly populated with characters. The novel,  \" far superior to Author Lin's whimsical The Importance of Living, may well become the classic background novel of modern China. \" < ref >  < /ref >  The magazine named it as one of nine novels that were  \" Books of the Year \"  in 1939. Others included Finnegans Wake by James Joyce and The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck. < ref >  < /ref > \n \n The New York Times reviewer wrote that  \" Mr. Lin has filled some 800 pages with a picturesque and leisurely account of how contemporary China grew and learned to live and adjusted itself to the fact, as he says in a preface, that 'men strive but the gods rule.' \"  The old has given way to the new, the review goes on, but Lin does not try to say which is right or wrong.  \" By Western standards it is a somewhat formless record, not always easy to follow, \"  but  \" by any standards it has strength, tolerance, humor, color, and dignity. \"  The reader should see why, he concludes, Pearl Buck has called in  \" the great novel of modern China. \"    < ref >  < /ref > \n \n The scholar Zuzana Dudasova, writing in 2019, called Moment  In Peking a  \" great novel \" , and went on to compare how Lin used the Daoist, Confucian, and popular elements with Pearl Buck's use of them in The Good Earth. In each, the author uses a distinctively Chinese worldview to give depth and metaphorical meanings to the story. \n \n ==Chinese translations== \n Lin originally wanted the poet Yu Dafu to do the Chinese translation, but Yu had only completed the first section when he was killed by the Japanese in World War II. Lin did not particularly like the first complete Chinese translation, which was done by 1941. \n \n In 1977 Zhang Zhenyu, a translator from Taiwan, created what is the most popular translation today, titled Jinghua Yanyun (). It was not available in mainland China until a publisher in Jilin issued a sanitized version in 1987. The current political climate permits Shaanxi Normal University Press to publish the full translation. Yu Dafu's son Yu Fei (\u90c1\u98db) finished his own translation in 1991, but his version, titled Shunxi Jinghua (), is not widely read. \n \n ==Adaptations== \n The novel has been adapted three times into a television drama, including a 1988 adaptation starring Angie Chiu, a 2005 adaptation starring Zhao Wei, and a 2014 adaptation starring Li Sheng. \n \n ==References and further reading== \n *  \n \n == Notes == \n  \n \n ==External links== \n  \n * Books: Books of the Year 1939.
